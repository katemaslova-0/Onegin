   A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
   A ball here, there a children"s treat,
   A ball in Peter"s capital,
   A bastard fame prohibited?
   A bearded postillion astride
   A beau is for Tattiana found!
   A beauty languidly at rest,
   A bill of fare hangs full in sight
   A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
   A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
   A boat with splashing oar floats by,
   A bogy conjured up in joke,
   A book at early morn perused.
   A bottle of a vintage white
   A box of terrible import.
   A breathless silence then, prolonged-
   A bristly bear of monstrous size!
   A canine face with horns thereon,
   A careless looker-on estranged
   A case of books he doth obtain-
   A certain little escapade
   A charm with it in conversation.
   A child devoid of childishness
   A constant harping on one tune,
   A coquette loves by calculation,
   A countenance perplexed and scared.
   A country damsel"s album trim,
   A crab upon a spider rides,
   A critic of the stage malicious,
   A cup of tea upon a tray.
   A curious interest disclose
   A dagger, asterisk, or note
   A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
   A deadly pallor, air distressed;
   A dinner, whimsical each course,
   A door he opens. But why shrank
   A double force unto their song
   A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
   A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
   A due which must to earth be paid.
   A duellist of classic mind,
   A dwarf adorned with tail, again
   A dying man with art to soothe,
   A faithful model she appeared
   A feeble version read below,
   A few of different temper deemed,
   A fiery and eccentric mind,
   A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
   A finished madrigal would frame
   A first success light pinions gave,
   A flimsy trace of musings past
   A fond and careful mother been.
   A fop, in dress pedantical.
   A forest now she sees in front
   A fragile bridge and insecure,
   A friar black approaching near,
   A friendly hand thy life hath ta"en!
   A gambling troop when he controlled,
   A game of chess would often play,
   A garden by a shining rill.
   A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
   A gust of passion never tore
   A hand of ice appeared to seize
   A happy destiny ordained:
   A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
   A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
   A hemisphere beneath her sway,
   A hermit"s life Onéguine led,
   A hidden meaning could impart,
   A hidden train of wild desire.
   A horse"s hoofs she hears-She shrinks!
   A hundred times will not repeat,
   A jolly song and distant horn;
   A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
   A joyous troop of little boys
   A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
   A kerchief round her silver hair
   A labour, torment, yet a joy,
   A lady draws the hostess near,
   A lady"s hand doth never kiss.
   A lancer captivates her heart!
   A lancer her soul dotes upon:
   A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
   A lethargy of sense, a trance,
   A letter for her hero meant:
   A life in common with the rest;
   A life of fact, not fiction, led-
   A little farther please to read
   A little Juvenal to spout,
   A little virgin mirror peeps.
   A load of care upon the maid.
   A loaded pistol in his hand.
   A love epistle he doth scrawl.
   A love which knew no limitation,
   A lover"s letter might convey,
   A maid hath oft, may yet again
   A maiden"s secrets-of the heart.
   A mansion-by the window, see!
   A marriageable maid matured,
   A mien unaltered she preserved,
   A mild quotation to translate,
   A million bipeds reckons thus
   A modern Regulus unchained,
   A moment effervescing stirs,
   A mournful temper on his Muse.
   A new acquaintance we must scan.
   A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
   A new proprietor arrived,
   A new world was made manifest!
   A noted fop who gambled hard.
   A notoriety proclaimed,
   A novel in Lafontaine"s style,
   A nursling yet for Hope to school.
   A pair of bullets-nought beside-
   A pair; though desolate my mind,
   A paragon of virtue he!
   A passing snowstorm wreathed away
   A passionate desire to bend
   A pensive sorrow in her glance
   A philosophic anchorite:
   A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
   A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
   A print without the picture"s grace,
   A promenade in twilight late
   A prudent man like you and brave
   A register of fleeting thought,
   A riding whip. She strolls along.
   A ring she heard the ancient strain:
   A rivulet beneath them shoots
   A Russian household simple quite,
   A Russian in Childe Harold"s cloak,
   A Russian poem"s mechanism
   A scant attendance Lenski showed
   A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
   A sense of social delight,
   A shape half cat and half a crane.
   A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
   A simple tombstone hath been set.
   A single being: "twas in fine
   A slave of actresses capricious,
   A smile from slumbering nature clear
   A something somehow have obtained,
   A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
   A sportsman who in covert lies.
   A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
   A stream, by winter"s ice unbound,
   A strong resemblance these possess-
   A substitute for lamps we hail!
   A table to the fire is brought,
   A tangled wilderness around.
   A tender couplet he combined,
   A thick immense neglected grove
   A timid love to banishment?-
   A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
   A tombstone, Aphrodite"s shrine,
   A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
   A trouble fell upon the sprites;
   A true account and in detail.
   A true Childe Harold my Eugene
   A valuable hostage gained,
   A Vampire fond of meditation,
   A very troublesome disease,
   A victim decked with golden leaves;
   A village and beneath, a wood,
   A vision desolate and drear
   A visionary mortified,
   A visionary personage
   A weary season was at hand-
   A while ago the winter spent,
   A whisper runs along the hall,
   A white and undulating pall
   A wild enthusiastic tongue,
   A windmill too a jig performs
   A wish from place to place to roam,
   A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
   A worthy object "tis, and well
   A young and handsome galliard.
   A young Armida"s lips to press,
   A young man motionless he saw,
   Abandon cities riotous,
   "Abandon hope for ever here!"
   Abandoned he his country seat,
   Abandoning insane delight,
   About the crop of hay, the wine,
   About the rain and flax and cattle."-
   Above the ashes of the dead.
   Above the humble urn of death.
   Above the yawning grave would fight,-
   Absorbed in melancholy mood
   Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
   Accelerates her hasty pace,
   Accents of rapture or despair
   Acquaintance instantly to make.
   Across her youth a shade had come,
   Across the Baltic"s salt sea waves,
   Across the gloom of heaven would sail
   Across the smiling face of dawn.
   Across the stage still madly sweep,
   Address to you one single phrase
   Adieu she to the matron said
   "Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
   Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
   Adieu! whate"er thou didst desire
   Admired his judgment, which was fine,
   Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
   Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
   Adorned with many a vision bright
   Adroitly seized and carried her;
   "Advance!"-
   Afar is borne by cruel fate,
   Afar, where clothed in green and gold
   Affection how did you requite?
   Affectionately yours till death.
   After the wedded couple strain;
   Again a century should scourge
   Again her rural life she sought,
   Again imagination blazed,
   Again in her ethereal dance?
   Again the giddy waltz repeats.
   Again the plague of boyhood-love?
   Against my inclination, friends,
   Age immature averse to cheat-
   Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
   Ah! brethren, what was my delight
   "Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
   Ah! he has gone the other way"-
   Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
   Ah! I still struggle to forget
   Ah! I"m so weak-my throbbing breast!
   Ah! it may be, affection true
   "Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
   Ah no! no faintness her attacked
   "Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"-
   Ah! than a spectre from the dead
   Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
   Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
   Akulka who was once Celine,
   "Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
   Alarm the winter journey gave.
   Alarmed by jealous agonies:
   Alas! abroad I cannot go.
   "Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
   Alas! for now before her passed
   Alas! he loved as in our times
   Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
   Alas! It is not hard to guess.
   Alas! life"s hours which swiftly fly
   "Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
   Alas! my friends, the years flit by
   Alas! my stomach it betrays
   Alas! she is as hard, behold,
   Alas! Tattiana fades away,
   Alas! the friend of childish days
   Alas! the youthful lover slain,
   Alas! with merited reproach.
   Albums magnificent which scare
   Alike by sighs and flattery.
   "Aline!"
   All about Olga-to a light
   All are amazed; but Lenski he
   All are constrained and fetters bear,
   All arise. To the door he goes.
   All breathless and without replies.
   All bustle when he makes a sign:
   All covered up with snow in heaps,
   All dark and silent hath become;
   All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
   All in the good old style appears,
   All is foreseen. My secret drear
   All mothers their sweet girls believed
   All Nature winter seemed to await,
   All overtures of friendship ended.
   All rattled in the ball-room vast,
   All silently hung down his head.
   All slumber. In the drawing-room
   All so distinct, and all so white!
   All sons of mental weariness.
   All that a poet could desire,
   All that industrial London brings
   All that perfection could desire;
   All that the heart would fain express-
   All the creations which below
   All the young people round about,
   All this I know is out of date,
   All this in many cases brings
   All this may be an empty dream,
   All this, my friends, translate aright:
   All this was novel to Eugene.
   All to the doctors Eugene send,
   All to the grand saloon are gone-
   All vanished as an echo goes.
   All visited him at first, of course;
   All which caprice and affluence craves,
   All which in Paris eager taste,
   All with urbanity betray,
   Allure the young gallant
   Almost became a poet say-
   Alone amid possessions great,
   Alone beneath your rooftree stay
   Alone beside it, gray and bent,
   Alone he doth his claret drink,
   Alone she gallops on her steed,
   Alone the princess sitteth there,
   Alone with my Venetian maid,
   Alone within his habitation
   Along Saint Petersburg"s paved streets,
   Along the hall, and high above
   Along the Neva"s bank he sleighs,
   Already Autumn chilled the sky,
   Already by repentance moved
   Already crisp hoar frosts impose
   Already dance to song proceeds;
   Already he grew phthisical.
   Already sings the nightingale.
   Also my wretched liberty
   Also one Viázemski, remarking
   Also the works of Fontenelle,
   Also their feet-yet ne"ertheless
   Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
   Also, to equalise the scales,
   Although her book did not contain
   Although it will not bear translation,
   Although the destined coffin nears,
   Although unknown to fame mayhap,
   Although we know that Eugene had
   Although we read him heaps of verse.
   Always together, eventide
   Am I to go through the whole list?"
   Amazed at the confusing crowd,
   Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
   Amid a serious disputation,
   Amid coquettes who pray to God
   Amid sly, pusillanimous
   Amid submissive herds of men
   Amid the awful emptiness
   Amid the company career.
   Amid the snowdrifts which surround
   Amid the soulless sons of pride
   Amidst successes flattering
   Among some ancient ballads thrust,
   Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
   An ace at fifteen paces bored.
   An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
   An almanac but eight years old.
   An ancient lady full of grace.-
   An ardent heart and yet so mild?-
   An ear to my confession lend;
   An ever transcendental flight;
   An exile from their troublous reign,
   An explanation: she was scared,
   An honourable course ye took,
   An hour passed by-another-till,
   An idle anchorite and sad,
   An infant maiden doth exhort
   An inn at every stage erect.
   An innate love of meditation,
   An invalid from lung complaint.
   An oval countenance and pink,
   And a boy handed round the cream.
   And a determined disposition,
   And a grand festival proceeds.
   And a guitar produced we see,
   And a half rubles down gave she;
   And a long time about her talked.
   And a malicious epigram
   And a new diadem supplied.
   And a romance in ancient style
   And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
   And about dawn upon his breast
   And after Albion"s proud lyre
   And after them at headlong pace
   And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
   And agitate my heart again;
   And aimless journeys did commence-
   And all in snow is buried deep.
   And all that from thy hand proceeds-
   And all the joys which Winter knows.
   And all the three to breakfast went;
   And all thy precious elegies,
   And all with one accord agreed,
   And all without her husband"s leave.
   And all your love on self bestow;
   And alphabetically tries
   And also fashionable beaux.
   And also that my feeble verse-
   And an elegiac poem wrote.
   And an enchanting shoulder shines
   And an encouragement did breathe
   And an habitual sense of pain;
   And an old gent the poet marking
   And ancient usages observed
   And as a country damsel roved,
   And at economy was great;
   And at the altar of their fame
   And at the stages bugs and fleas
   And at the table sat her down.
   And barely visible the smoke
   And be as happy-as I might.
   And be not in advance severe.
   And beats with rapid foot the floor.
   And beckon to the passing sails.
   And bends her mirror on the moon,
   And better, if I judge aright;
   And bitter tears of fright I shed.
   And bitter torment never known.
   And bless mankind with full delight.
   And blest me, sinking to the grave.
   And blest the shadows of the night.
   And blush to own himself reflect.
   And boiling o"er with friendly heat,
   And both of dull existence tired,
   And breathe a drama in his ear.
   And breathe the balmy breath of night;
   And breathes upon the chilly glass,
   And brooding o"er the ills he bore,
   And buried deep in meditation,
   And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
   And by a partial temper stirred
   And by a sweet delusion he
   And by degrees upon him grew
   And by that shady rivulet
   And by the fiddle"s rushing sound
   And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
   And, by the way, I here assert
   And by the world repeated oft,
   And calmly sleeps the hours away,
   And can it be? But late a child
   And cannot anything conceal,
   And care but little for its ends.
   And cares not farther to proceed;
   And chattering loud sit down to dine.
   And Christian folk will, I expect,
   And clad in airy costume took
   And Comet champagne foaming flows.
   And comfort of each country dame,
   And consolation soon begot.
   And contemplative dreaminess;
   And cool sagacious mind he had:
   And courtier, fop, and usurer
   And cried within myself: "tis he!
   And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
   And cry: he was a poet great!
   And dames of fine organisations,
   And dark and drear the evenings were,
   And death before the husband wide
   And deem the world perfection is!
   And devastate the woods around.
   And disappear in space; then she
   And distance interposed in vain,
   And ditties of the steppe she loved.
   And dost thou know her?"-"We live near."
   And dream of life"s delightful dawn?
   And due precautions take betimes.
   And ease and fashionable waste,-
   And ease the tortures of the heart-
   And education runs to waste,
   And (elbows on the table) they
   And endless the cotillon seemed
   And enmity and hope and love-
   And Eugene ever in her soul
   And Eugene soon discovered there
   And every morning I awake
   And every year distributed
   And exclamations and good cheer.
   And exclamations interlaced.
   And eye which gleams with inspiration-
   And far removed from rumour vain;
   And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
   And fashionable magazines,
   And fashion"s gay frivolities;
   And female tears hysterical,
   And fields my joys have ever been;
   And finally he deigns let fall
   And finally, upon his bed
   And fits of coughing racked her chest.
   And fled afar-she followed me.
   And Fliànoff, pensioned councillor,
   And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
   And flooded all the level ground.
   And flowed harmoniously. He took
   And following them ye might espy
   And for a time our course delay,
   And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
   And form a network left and right;
   And freezing fits of weariness.
   And from his dressing-room would pass
   And from the country all around
   And from the Millionaya afar
   And from the misty woodland nigh
   And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
   And full of innocent delight,
   And gallicisms I love as well
   And galloped home. But pistols twain,
   And gallops to her house away.
   And gave himself but little pain
   And gazed around with eyes of flame;
   And gently hovered o"er my head?
   And glasses unemployed all night;
   And glittering simpletons beside;
   And gloomy epigrams malicious.
   And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
   And gossip of the town and fashion
   And gradually day unfolds.
   And grant his weary bones their rest
   And grant success to labour long;
   And grasp a stirrup fortunate-
   And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
   And grown more curious by far
   And had with waddling in the end
   And handsome countenance combined,
   And, hanging down her head, the maid
   And happy unto you appear.
   And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
   And harmony was soon restored.
   And hastened to his uncle"s side,
   And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
   And hated casual visitors,
   And hates the world"s discordant ways.
   And he had made her heart beat quick!
   And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
   And he who, jealousy disarmed,
   And heard a voice cry-Why! He"s killed!-
   And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
   And, heaving a regretful sigh,
   "And he-but of him presently-
   And heedless of approval seems,
   And her bespangled robe doth wave
   And her upon the threshold laid.
   And her voice sweeter than the sounds
   And herds of oxen wandering low;
   And his poor basten sandal knits.
   And his strange conduct at the dance
   And homeward like an arrow tore.
   And honestly "tis my belief
   And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
   And hot with jealous indignation,
   And hurried home his awful freight.
   And husbands" tedious amity?
   And I admired their common sense
   And I, amid the friendly crowd,
   And I confess that now-a-days
   And I discerned through Fancy"s prism
   And I, remembering Svetlana,
   And I to give thee cakes was wont?"-
   And if Tattiana mine had found-
   And impiously should declare,
   And in a vision, sinless, bright,
   And in a whisper did repeat:
   And in addition youth is flame
   And in her conversation drawled.
   And in her grasp the letter shakes,
   And in her hand a French romance.
   And in her languid bosom raise
   And in her native language she
   And in reality one day
   And in society might shed
   And in the bathroom did command
   And in the final tome we learnt,
   And in the frosty night alone
   And in the morning doth not know
   And in the Summer Garden rove.
   And, inspiration firing me,
   And irrigate them with champagne;
   And irritates the appetite.
   And is all light within destroyed?
   "And is it long since back he came?
   "And is it," meditates Eugene.
   "And is it she? It must be-no-
   And is it true and not a jest,
   And is it true her garland bright
   And isolated from all men,
   And it may be a secret dread
   And jests doth recapitulate.
   And jolting jarred the window-frames.
   And, joy of souls effeminate,
   And judgment which unsteady veers
   And kindness Tania was impressed,
   And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
   And leads a solitary life?
   And leaning "gainst the portal closed
   And leans upon the monster"s arm,
   And leave a marsh the fertile ground
   And led me off to church with song."
   And Lenski, closing his left eye,
   And Lenski followed-a light broke-
   And lessons to his children read.
   And life and fate in turn selected
   And like a palisade flit by.
   And like a shadow haunted her.
   And like Childe Harold gloomily
   And like his shadow dogged his life,
   And like Napoleons each of us
   And like the prisoner"s our delight
   And Limburg cheese alive and old
   And linen on him doth bestow.
   And lo! five paces more they pass,
   And lo! he is already there!
   And lo! where lies a marble tomb
   And lonely through the forest creeps."
   And long her eyes as through a haze
   And long internal agitation
   And long perukes hath vanishèd.
   And love"s delicious diadem
   And loves you as-a relative!
   And madrigals I"m asked to write!
   And make a dark existence shine
   And many a caravan on high
   And many a day thereafter laid
   And many another slily sneered;
   And marking Tania"s agitation,
   And marvels deemed he thus should view.
   And may fall headlong any time.
   And meditative from the spot
   And meditative homeward goes,
   And mental elasticity.
   And modest, cheerful as the morn,
   And more imagination teems.
   And Moscow many a beauty fair:
   And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
   And my dark soul to light was brought;
   And my Eugene the path must trace-
   And my romance"s open theme
   And my Tattiana now began
   And naked uniformity.
   And natural benevolence,
   And necessary fools allowed.
   And never hath our language proud
   And never was the ear affright
   And no ridiculous report,
   And not a speck of dirt descried.
   And nothing more important sees;
   And now a fickle flirt and wild,
   And now he views forgotten foes,
   And now his youthful heart desires
   And now, I mournfully confess,
   And now philanthropy his soul,
   And now she skips and now she springs
   And now "tis night, the guardian moon
   And now upon the snow in thaw
   And now we hear delightedly
   And numerous pages had preserved
   And o"er the granite coping bent,
   And of the attic. Honestly,
   And of the irksome harness tires,
   And oft at eventide a throng
   And oft in whispers would impart
   And oft its Dictionary thumb.
   And oh! what verses, what delights,
   And on the footstool sitting down
   And on the last one, underlined:
   And others rise ephemeral!
   And ought he not to disregard
   And our successors soon shall drive
   And our swift troikas never tire;
   And overcome antipathies
   And pallid nature trembling grieves,
   And past the threshold of decay,
   And pauses oft to serve out bread.
   And pelt him with cherries,
   And physic bring with mournful face,
   And platitudes and pedantry,
   And pleasure"s daily blandishment,
   And pressed her hand-the crimson blush
   And privileges nice allowed,
   And rapid whirl of many feet,
   And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
   And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
   And read our newspapers scarce ever,
   And reads with rapid eager eye
   And rest from bygone days of strife.
   And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
   And rising from her bench proceeds;
   And roofs near morn blanched o"er with snow;
   And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
   And sallied forth one brilliant morn-
   And satisfied with vengeance ta"en.
   And saying this Vladimir drained
   And scanned in silence its content.
   And Schiller read by candlelight.
   And secretly their views expound.
   And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
   And sermon-but in that dread hour
   And shall adopt some new caprice.
   And she at last hath us deceived;
   And she despite herself would waste
   And she to whom my lyre would fain,
   And shorter had the days become.
   And showed with an uncertain light
   And shut him in a lonely nook.
   And silent as the maid Svetlana
   And silently I here must die-
   And since I pulled thee by the ear-
   And slowly life coagulates-
   And so departed. But Eugene,
   And so my noon hath come! If so,
   And so Tattiana was her name,
   And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
   And so-God bless them, if He list.
   And solitude and calm delight,
   And solitude and calm delight.
   And sometimes into snares as well
   And soon imagination threw
   And soon Lel hovered o"er her head.
   And soon Onéguine"s door beside
   And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
   And spectacles, his knitting staid
   And spouted it with lyric fire-
   And spur my spirit"s torpid mood!
   And starting suddenly doth say:
   And stay whose length none recollects.
   And still the coachmen round the fires
   And stoves of various shapes abound.
   And straight returning whence he came,
   And stupid censors passionate;
   And such unconsciously he led,
   And sulked in silent indignation;
   And supercilious dames she glides,
   And supper. In the country we
   And swifter than the swallow"s flight.
   And Tania"s husband soon appeared.-
   And tears of reconciliation:
   And terrify a swarm of ducks,
   And testy gamesters do engage
   And that a bottle sealed with tar
   And that no longer could inspire.
   And that too often we receive
   And that unrivalled paragon,
   And the attendants called in haste.
   And the bad book accompanies.
   And the cast-iron statuette
   And the cold beauties of the season:
   And the conviction soon arose,
   And the dark fringe of men, like frames
   And the eternal lorgnette through
   And the extent of his caprice;
   And the fair sex as light as down!
   And the far mountains daintily
   And the heart"s agitated dreams.
   And the kind-hearted servitors:
   And the lime alley"s twilight dim
   And the lone secret of her heart,
   And the more surely we ensnare
   And the newcomers welcome bade.
   And the old nurse a brief prayer said
   And the recesses of my mind
   And the sagacious Triquet back
   And the saloon threw open wide;
   And the Skatènines, aged pair,
   And the suspicious veteran old,
   And the world met her smilingly,
   And the young damsel from the town,
   And the young girl appeared before
   And the young ladies fortunes told,
   And the young revellers of past times
   And then a cup of coffee drank,
   And then made merry pope and guest,
   And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
   And then she soon "twixt work and leisure
   And then the stanzas of my theme
   And then to meditate for days
   And then with blind credulity
   And these the attentive maid observed
   And they the waters recommend.
   And think: here lies who loved me well,
   And this fifth canto ought to be
   And this the faithful one allows,
   And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
   And thou, persistent to the end,
   And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
   And thou, youth"s early inspiration,
   And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
   And though her soul might be confused,
   And though I read it with distress,
   And though perchance a lady may
   And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."
   And thoughts of Olga first impressed
   And through the lofty windows views
   And thus ancestral dust reveres.
   And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
   And thus he never fell among
   And thus he spent eight years of time,
   And thus in season the rich field
   And thus it is "twould cause me pain
   And thus secures the prey we seek.
   And thus unto her nurse did say:
   And thy inebriating wave
   And thy protection I implore.
   And tiresome rogues ridiculous
   And to Onéguine far away
   And to revive Tattiana seemed.
   And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
   And to the field of honour led;
   And to these letters and these tears.
   And town and friends forgotten quite.
   And traces with a slender finger
   And triumphs in career erotic.
   And true, his pistol"s faultless aim
   And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
   And turned aside the drapery;
   And turned to leave immediately,
   And two old pines their branches spread-
   And unto whom we all allude
   And usually despised it too),
   And vanish like a bird in air.
   And various chords upon it proves,
   And vehemently though amazed
   And viewed the door with cunning eye.
   And views amongst themselves advance
   And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
   And visit many a foreign clime,
   And vows will probably be signed:
   And wakened him with the loud cry:
   And watch her eye"s full glance to meet.
   And we-an unattractive set-
   And well-instructed to betray!
   And what from its recess appears?
   And what like menaces fatigues,
   And what resulted? Drunk with love,
   And what she from the cards inferred.
   And what the old man might bequeath.
   And what will Destiny concede?"
   And when for Olga nurse arrayed
   And when her violence reviewed-
   And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
   And when the watery mirror gleamed
   And where a madrigal occurs
   And where at last his bones repose
   And where may be her sister now?
   And where tempestuous love"s desires,
   And where Thalia softly dreams
   And where the admirable streams
   And where the billows hoarsely raise
   And wheresoe"er thy footsteps err,
   And who is not a tiresome thief?
   And who the rent-roll of his race
   And wholly occupied his day-
   And wild among them grew her words-
   And wild festivities among
   And wildly waves its arms and storms;
   And wisely gallops to the hill.
   And wished to say to him farewell.
   And with emotional delight
   And with gray hair ambrosial
   And with his lot in life content,
   And with remorseful anguish filled,
   And would by candlelight arise.
   And yet he in your cause would strive
   And yet oblivion forbade.
   And yet the city"s flower was there,
   And you, my youthful damsels fair,
   And you, O maids immaculate,
   And youthful madness, youthful fires.
   Anew the flames of passion start
   Angel or fiend malevolent.
   Anicia soon appears, the door
   Announcing to him dinner-time.
   Another bard with art divine
   Another could her heart engage,
   Another could her woe assuage
   Another his betrothed was given;
   Another passed; "twas just the same.
   Another time, so willed it Fate,
   Another! to none other I
   Another tribune of the ball
   Another visit hastes to pay.
   Another with cock"s head appeared,
   Anticipating woe she pined,
   Antiquity no pleasure gave,
   Appear; along the road of Tver
   Appear attuned to softer chords;
   Appeared, Don"s effervescing boast,
   Applause, the people"s donative.
   Approach, approach; I am thine own."
   Approach not to gaze at
   Approach not to hearken
   Approaches Olga and the pair
   Are admirable, my dear friend,
   Are all your relatives quite well?
   Are not with elegance impressed.
   Are oft deceptive-like their feet.
   Are turned upon her. All combine
   Are ye replaced by other maids
   Arising with the morning"s light,
   Around her neck, now violently
   Around my stanzas incomplete
   Around the carriage of the pair-
   Around the garden homeward hies.
   Around the meadow and the grove.
   Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
   Aroused in him some tenderness.
   Aroused in him sweet reverie.
   Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
   Arouses rustics from their sleep.
   Arrange without the least delay-
   As a babe"s slumber, or the light
   As a poetic life serene,
   As bees who leave their dainty store
   As butterflies to blossoms cling.
   As cyphers others to appraise,
   As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
   As deaf and silly doth remain,
   As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
   As every journal now entreats,
   As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
   As formerly much agitation.
   As formerly the shepherd sits
   As giddy youth"s hilarity-
   As hope uncertain and as sweet,
   As if against obstruction sore
   As if he cruelly had joked!
   As if impossible it were
   As if it were some funeral feast.
   As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
   As if with eider-down is filled.
   As in a garden when I grew,
   As in a thicket"s humble shade,
   As in her heart the thought sank home,
   As in some frenzied dream of fear
   As in the timid forest deer,
   As in their turn the seasons roll.
   As it were, tore himself away.
   As lordly mansions ought to be,
   As many dinners I rehearse,
   As many entertainments be!
   As men who much had done that day.
   As oft to meat and drink advert,
   As on the rapid wings of thought
   As once, to fill the rapid page
   As one who bivouacs afield,
   As partner of my mournful days,
   As rosy lips without a smile,
   As Saadi anciently averred
   As storms which in chill autumn rage
   As the reflection of his age,
   As the sins of my youthful days
   As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
   As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
   As to a worthy man and good!
   As vernal storms the fields athwart.
   As we lure the young gallant,
   As when the tempest"s veil is drawn
   As Winter in their purity,
   As with innumerable fires.
   As yet none had discovered aught;
   As your light footprints on the green.
   Aside she casts her veil of gauze
   Aside the foes their mantles threw,
   Assemble from the neighbourhood:
   Assemblies oligarchical
   Assigned a lodging, from the hall
   Assistance ever will extend,
   Assuredly should not have been
   Asunder was and hate prepared?
   At a great feast against desire,
   At an old aunt"s they had arrived
   At each extreme one takes his stand,
   At early morn returns the maid
   At eighteen not to play the fool!
   At eventide would hither come,
   At fifty who relief obtained
   At first, but soon became inured
   At first for books was disinclined,
   At first, I clung to secrecy:
   At first such contradictions wrought
   At forty suffered from the gout,
   At his pale brow a shot to have,
   At home arriving he addressed
   At last became a ruined man.
   At last is shrunk and withered quite?
   At last my father gave his blessing,
   At last the author!" cries Mamma.
   At least by show of sympathy;
   At least their accents and their words
   At Làrina"s abode produced
   "At Làrina"s."-"Hem, that is queer!
   At morn an icy bath within
   At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
   At morn I must assuredly
   At neighbouring hospitalities.
   At prisoner"s base she never played.
   At Russ she was by no means clever
   At seven in summer rose from bed,
   At table she was sitting by
   At the front gates, but in brief space
   At the same hour she oped her eyes
   At thirty who was married well,
   At this time almost understood.
   At times, if only once a week,
   At times my reason almost bends,
   At times talk nonsense with design;
   At times three words to him addressed
   At times to silence would resort,
   At twenty who was prig or swell,
   At womankind he growled a curse,
   Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
   Athwart the snow four paces came-
   Attend in male attire arrayed.
   Attentive be unto my rhymes
   Attentive listened to his speech,
   Attentive listened to the lad.
   Attentive to the echoing sound,
   Attentive to the heart"s first beating,
   Attractive in its banefulness?
   Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
   Aurora"s ruddy rays of light-
   Authors replete with sacred fire
   Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
   Avenge himself in proper style.
   Avowal then "twas time to pray,
   Await the long-delayed caress.
   Awaiting on the shore I roam
   Awakens secret merriment
   Away! and cease to ring their praise
   Away her golden earrings tore;
   Away, Tattiana, hath been ta"en.
   Awhile sound conversation seems
   Awhile this beauty captivated,
   Aye bids ye in some way or other-
   Back to his regiment must roam.
   Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
   Balconies, lion"s heads on doors,
   Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
   Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
   Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
   Barely to draw her breath she seems,
   Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
   Barking, young ladies" osculations,
   Basins and jugs-well! everything
   Bear gone-she at the threshold placed;
   Beats that of friends and relatives:
   Because a member I became.
   Because he could not gourmandise
   Because he yawned at the bare view
   Because her passion wanted art,
   Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
   Because in singleness of thought
   Because my lord, in battles maimed,
   Because she was so innocent,
   Become a faithful wife and e"en
   Become alarmed. So never mind!
   Bedding is laid out and to all
   Before a cold indifferent crowd,
   Before a fire which feebly glows
   Before he eighteen years attained.
   Before her straight with roguish eyes.
   Before him her wild game of chance.
   Before him red roast beef is seen
   Before it ran a stream. Behold!
   Before such fond simplicity
   Before the altar, lo! the pair,
   Before the dregs they shall divine
   Before whom once in solitude,
   Before whose inexperienced sight
   Before you agonized to die-
   Begins to talk of this and that,
   Behind her a grave general.
   Behind, of glasses an array,
   Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
   Behind the mountain sank the moon.
   Behold! beside their dwelling groups
   Behold! green tables are brought forth,
   Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
   "Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
   Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain-"
   Behold! orthography despising,
   Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
   Behold! than polished floor more nice
   Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
   Behold the dames who once were fine
   Behold! the moon was shining bright
   Behold! the world"s opinion!
   Being from hell or heaven sent,
   Believe me, of my present shame
   Believed, the people"s wisdom weird,
   Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
   Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
   Beneath her downy pillow placed,
   Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
   Beneath her parents" eyes the maid
   Beneath her roaring opened wide:
   Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
   Beneath his lips" devouring kiss.
   Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
   Beneath the flag of Quietude,
   Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
   Beneath the sheltering oak tree"s shade
   Beneath the silver of the moon
   Beneath the table-cloth of white,
   Beneath the window-sill his bed,
   Beside a nameless rivulet,
   Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
   Beside our youthful heroine fair,
   Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
   Beside the stormy sea one day
   Beside the thundering abyss
   Besides, a duellist well-known
   Besides the hobbies of a spouse
   Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
   Better than Chateaubriand did
   Between myself and my Eugene,
   Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
   Between the stalls, along the toes;
   Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
   Beyond the city-barriers haste.
   Beyond this may attempt to write.
   Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
   Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
   Blank, unapproachable and cold.
   Blest be the labours of the light,
   Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
   Books he abandoned like the fair,
   "Boredom, my friend, behold the ill-"
   Born of a babbler in a loft
   Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
   Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
   Both day and night he now must pass
   Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
   Both for the nails and for the tushes.
   Both natural and truthful seemed.
   Both were expectant of the hate
   Both were of passion satiate
   Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
   Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
   Bouyànoff too, my cousin, wore
   Bouyànoff whisked off Poustiakova.
   Bouyànoff, wrathful cousin mine,
   Bows and the scrape of many feet,
   Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
   Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
   Bright blazed the window of the place,
   Bright day will then begin to burn,
   Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
   "Bring dinner now without delay!"
   Bringing his partner corpulent
   Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
   Brought by a pedlar vagabond
   Bruin is marching at her back!
   Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
   Buried in meditation deep,
   But Adam Smith to read appeared,
   But, after mutual compliments,
   But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead-
   But, as he never opened them,
   But, as I said, Zaretski mine
   But as to fighting-"twill appear!
   But at a later, sterile age,
   But at her shriek ran forth with noise
   But better loved the soft repose
   But boldly I myself resign:
   But borne in spirit far away
   But by degrees the crowd begin
   But by fantastic dreams distraught,
   But cannot anyhow evade
   But cannot stand the northern cold.
   But competition I abjure
   But contrary to her advice
   But could not. Then she questioned him:-
   "But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
   "But death from him will be delight.
   But deeming all this nonsense pure,
   But dinner-time comes. Two and two
   But enough! Now, "tis my intent
   But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
   But Eugene, hating litigation
   But Eugene, incontestably,
   But Eugene long hath left the press
   But Eugene was by fate preserved,
   But even thus not now-a-days!
   But fashionable hatred"s flame
   But finally grew bored by her.
   But finally he oped his eyes
   But finally in wedlock bind.
   But finally she heaves a sigh,
   But finally she softly said:
   But first permission did request
   But followed the strict rules of art,
   But fools-their calumnies and sneers"-
   But Fortune cast our lots apart
   But from the interview what flowed?
   But from the Muses" loftiest height
   But gazes on Onéguine"s face
   But grant with magnanimity

   But he desired not to beguile
   But he who by the Muse was nursed
   But, her own room in memory,
   But home his body to despatch
   But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
   But, howsoe"er his lot were cast,
   But I abandoned their array,
   But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
   But I am now another"s bride-
   But I await thee: scarce alive
   But I came not to adulate:
   But I, in love, was mute and dull.
   But I must add to what I write
   But I must now employ my Muse
   But I perceive thou dost not heed-"
   But I the products of my Muse,
   But I was sharp in times gone by.
   But if my lot unfortunate
   But if the truth I must relate,
   But in his heart dissatisfied,
   But in the drawing-room all appeared
   But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
   But it grew late; he must not stay;
   But I-what is all this to me?
   But kindness from his eye had beamed
   But, knowing not the actual truth,
   But Lenski, having no desire
   But Lenski, I should be so glad
   But Lenski madrigals ne"er wrote
   But lights incendiary flames
   But little warmth the fireplace lends,
   But lo! already the moon"s light
   "But lo! forth from the valleys dun
   But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
   But lo! the friends to chat commence.
   But lonely beneath Finnish skies
   But look you-ah! do not refuse."
   But Lord! from friends deliver me!
   But man of sense and probity.
   But memory like a serpent"s tooth
   But merely to exasperate;
   But more the passions occupy
   But my Onéguine the whole eve
   But my Tattiana, on my soul,
   But my Tattiana"s eyes were dry.
   "But, mátushka, to Moscow you
   But no reply unto her made.
   But not at present, though sincerely
   But nothing changed in them is seen,
   But nought for this Tattiana cares.
   But now a question in this wise
   But now all doubt was set aside,
   But now in her effulgence pale
   But now my mind is desolate,
   But now our hero we must leave
   But now our minds are mystified
   But now ridiculous a bit.
   But now, what wretched roads one sees,
   But nowhere can she find repose,
   But now-my very blood congeals,
   But now-none heeds the monument
   But now-what brings you to my feet?-
   But, O ye tomes without compare,
   But of this love, e"en casually,
   But Olga would not such peruse.
   But on the third of grove and mead
   But once more pensive and distressed
   But one buffoon unhappy deemed
   But one thought only filled his mind,
   But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,

   But since to the backdoor they led
   But sits in bed with air depressed,
   But somehow there shone in his look
   But soon she altered all her ways,
   But soon their choice seemed to her mind
   But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
   But stares into the darkness deep.
   But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
   But still more stupid did appear
   But still remembrance to him clings,
   But stop! I will present thee, if

   By visions who was ne"er deranged
   By waters shining tranquilly,
   By what idea or observation
   By whom the youthful bard was slain?"-
   Byron"s capricious phantasy
   Calling to mind your icy look
   Callous to all he seemed to be.
   Callous to all on earth become-
   Calm and without embarrassment,
   Calmly her eyes encounter his-
   Came forth in all her magic sheen.
   Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
   Can count the time without much fuss-
   Can hearty welcome give alone.
   "Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
   Can lower depths beyond remain?
   Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
   Can she have been a moment gone
   Can we not stealthily make out
   Cannot they amicably smile

   Capers applauds with clap of hands,
   Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fêtes;
   Careless of every social rule,
   Careless of fame his spirit high
   Caricatures he now designed
   Carried a truth divine away;
   Carried away by ecstasy,
   Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
   Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
   Cast down his eyes in trepidation
   Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
   Caught him and by the collar took
   Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
   Ceased for a space all chattering.
   Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
   Certain misfortune near opined.
   Certainly not Eugene alone
   Chained to his bedside night and day
   Change of position had essayed,
   Charming is your sincerity,
   Charming with grave simplicity.
   Charms more enduring in the end.
   Chief rascal, pot-house president,
   Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,

   Contented and with victuals stored,
   Conventionality"s dull tool-
   Corneille"s majestic genius,
   Corset and album and Pauline,
   Could in a humble sphere despise,
   Could in romantic mantle drape
   Could not conceive how serious Grimm
   Could not eclipse her neighbour"s light.
   Could not in that brief moment guess!
   Could taste the pleasures of the road.
   Cousin, rememb"rest Grandison?"
   Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
   Cropped in the latest style his hair,
   Crunching the morning snow she treads;
   Crush and confusion in the hall,
   Crushing and a confusing noise;
   Cunning already to display
   Cursing his own stupidity,
   Curtly announcing for the fray
   Custom the despot soon prevails.
   Customs by ages sanctified,
   Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
   Daily of love in solitude.
   Dally with a dishevelled tress
   Danced the mazurka gracefully,
   Dared calmly cleanse his nails "fore him,
   Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
   Dark shadows thicken-a dread cry
   Dark, unavailing reverie,
   Dark was the valley and the wood
   Debate commanded ample food-
   Deeming himself a veteran scarred
   Deep in our mother Earth"s chill breast!"
   Deep in the distant province rude,
   Deep in the greenwood far away?
   Deep into debt his father ran;
   Deliberate approach of guests
   Delicious nature, thee I fly,
   Delicious visions, jests and fights!
   Delighted, almost sane in mind.
   Delighted glances in return;
   Delighted much his former ways
   "Delighted."-"When?"-"This very night.
   Delusions of a mind untried,
   Demands that I translate for you

   Did seem to greet the youthful year;
   Did they not all the Russian tongue

   Divinity without access

   Do all things which to mirth incline.
   Do me a favour and appear.

   Do not excuse yourself. I read
   "Do not-you might-suspicious be;
   Do we alone our losses mourn
   Do we foresee in troubled dreams
   Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
   Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
   Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
   Domestic life attracts me still,
   Doth his brow wretchedness declare
   Doth in her gentle eye appear.
   Doth in us or our names appear
   Doth love"s incautiousness in her
   Doth on the billiard table rest,
   Doth seem to him the festal scene.
   Doubt and uncertainty decide:
   Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
   Drank to her health in the first place,

   Dressing as quickly as he can,

   Drive on! the city barriers hoary
   Drive out the cattle from their shed,
   Driving abreast three horses gray.
   Drunk as a fly; and thus the French

   Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
   Ere the bright messenger had set.

   Espying, Eugene with a smile
   Esteemed him much as the world goes.
   Et cetera; but nothing showed
   Eternally to imitate
   Eugene at first began to dream,
   Eugene designed with me to start
   Eugene directs the trusty man
   Eugene fell prostrate at her feet-
   Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
   Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
   Eugene, more tolerant than this
   Eugene of course related nought,
   Eugene was touched with sympathy;
   Eugene would speak regarding these.
   Euphonious, though I know a spice
   Even amusing fools we miss
   Even as Moscow, city proud.
   Even as the love of children dear.
   Even beneath her parents" roof
   Even so! His passions soon abated,
   Even the rosy wafer dries
   Eventually petrify
   Ever absorbed a maid so much:
   Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
   Ever receive with kindly hearts
   Ever to hear the same replies
   Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
   Examine her from head to foot.
   Examined, mended, newly found
   Except one by the window placed
   Exceptionless as no rule is,
   Exclaiming, "We must change "em all!
   Excruciate the heart and late
   Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
   Existence calmly sped along,
   Existence without wife or friends,
   Existence would not make a curse,
   Exist-that their immortal band
   Extended-haunt which Dryads love.
   Extinct the flame which once had fired;
   Extinguished ashes do not blaze-
   Faces which we meet everywhere
   Fair object of my guileless lay,
   Fair source of every fine idea,
   Faithfully shall I now depict,
   Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
   False confidence or doubt to impart,
   Familiar to him long ago.
   Fantastic images shall swarm
   Far from his Italy-his own.
   Far from the rest the pair would creep
   Farewell! thou golden days of love!
   Farther Tattiana"s walks extend-
   Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
   Fashion is there immutable,
   Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
   Fearing his pupil to annoy,
   Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
   Feeling in others much esteemed.
   Feeling is silly, dangerous.
   Feelings which long had ceased to be
   Felled a calumniator base!
   Finally tost his arms in air
   First reconciled and then content;
   Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
   Flew to collect his rural tax;
   Flies past the porter to the stair,
   Fly frequent to my solitude,
   Foeman or friend, I do aspire
   Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
   Follow up love-a secret meeting
   Fond declarations they invite
   For a fictitious misanthrope,
   For a protracted space of time.
   For Ay is like a mistress fair,
   For baseness of the spirit scorns,
   For consecrate to me he fell
   For dolls, e"en from her earliest years,
   For empty sound the rascal swore he
   For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
   For ever faithful will abide."
   For ever with thy tattling lyre,
   For ever your Tattiana leave.
   For evermore had disappeared.
   For evermore is separate.
   For every loyal Russian breast!
   For first "madame" his wants observed,
   For folly"s dues thou hadst to pay.
   For, from the outset, "twas unjust
   For God"s sake, Lenski, don"t begin!
   For him an honourable grave,
   For him were but of little worth,
   For I myself was thirteen quite;
   For journalistic deglutition
   For law I far niente take
   For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
   For long he had endured them all.
   For long-for ever. To be sure
   For maiden"s hearing deemed unfit),
   For Moscow fops and Circes each
   For my wild garden and bookcase,-
   For o"er a word to fashion known,
   For on their brows I trembling read
   For otherwise-God only knows!
   For our amusement ever made
   For our Automedons are fire
   For patience, reader, I must plead!
   For promises her feet reveal
   For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
   For rural solitude and dreams,
   For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
   For shame lift up the modest maid.
   For summer to the country flown,
   For tallow, wood and other things
   For the first time the hammer clicks.
   For the impatient chief instead.
   For the young poet they display.
   For there he left a mournful trace.
   For treachery had done its worst;
   For twice you came to them and yet
   For two whole days it seemed a change
   For us, may be for many a year.
   For visions of my childish years
   For was it not her duty to
   For which no springtime shall appear?
   (For which our praise he hath deserved).
   For which the poet agonized
   For who imposture can endure,
   For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
   For your instruction here to tell
   Forgive me! Such the love I bear
   Forgive the fever youth inspires,
   Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
   Forgotten in the village lone,
   Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
   Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
   Fortune the poet had repaid.
   Found out the secret how at pleasure
   Found the ideal of my youth,
   Found them in darkness side by side,
   Four deadly paces do they span;
   Fragments of northern poetry,
   Free, I renewed the idolatry
   Free, in the blossom of his spring,
   Free scope he yields unto his glance,
   Frequent and rapid doth his glance
   Fresh aspirations I have known,
   Fresh cause of quarrel then I"ll find,
   Friends and companions,
   Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
   Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
   Friends of the sons of every land,
   Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
   From apprehension of the cost,
   From boxes or from stalls in rows.
   From careless stanzas such as these,
   From everything the heart held dear
   From first to last page to the rim.
   From gales a hill behind was seen;
   From Gottingen inspired he came,
   From habit or maliciously,
   From hall to yard and garden flies,
   From happy inspiration flow,
   From hence engrossed in thought profound
   From henceforth I confide to thee!
   From her half-open vest of night.
   From her my lips shall learn the tongue
   From mere vacuity of mind
   From public and from private ties,
   From Romulus unto our day.
   From shades of the relentless past.
   From storms protection having sought,
   From such digressions wholly free.
   From the dread pistol turn away.
   From the moist cork the bottle freed
   From whose analysis minute
   From you too Eugene took to flight,
   Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
   Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
   Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
   Full many a glance like lightning flash,
   Full many a lovely star hath night
   Full of exasperating thought.
   Funeral amateurs abound!
   Furious he from the table rose;
   Gallop, mazurka, waltzing-see!
   Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
   Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
   Gazing into his face, she said:
   Gazing on Lenski"s corse did stand-
   Gazing upon a note below.
   Gently for pranks he would reprove
   Gifts such as these alone could prize,
   Girls in anticipation skip!
   Girls the kashourka much prefer.
   Give me just half a glass of wine-
   Glides with a more luxurious ease;
   Gliding in negligent career,
   Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
   Glittered in a perspective long,
   Glory with which our history teems
   Go hear the rustling of the oaks
   Go, on the Neva"s bank appear,
   God grant I meet not at a ball
   God grant that all who herein glance,
   God knows! The very trace is lost.
   God save his soul eternally
   Goddess of lovers" tender sighs.
   Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
   "Good-bye, Onéguine, I must go."-
   Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
   Grant that I err not on the road."
   Grasped a long knife and instantly
   Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
   Gravely repeating to another
   Great sacrifices for his sake!
   Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
   Grew like a lily pure and white,
   Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
   Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
   Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
   Guards fondly hope"s uncertain dream.
   Guillot behind a pollard stood;
   Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
   Gvozdine, Bouyànoff, Pétòushkoff
   Habit alleviates the grief
   Habit was given us in distress
   Habit would bring indifference.
   Had a deluded victim been
   Had bid her sigh for without hope-
   Had come both friends and enemies-
   Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
   Had finished life amid his sons,
   "Had he been long here, and where from?
   Had killed me had the like been told."
   Had let fall many a bitter tear:
   Had much to do at home that day,
   Had not yet withered his young breast.
   Had perished a creative mind,
   Had reconciled the pair anew!
   Had rendered him an invalid;
   Had run across her path at speed,
   Had to compose in secret rhymes,
   Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
   Handbook of fashionable phrase
   Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
   Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
   Happy and glorious. But this brings
   Happy he who in youth was young,
   Happy who quit life"s banquet seat
   Happy who thereto can unite
   Happy who timely grew mature,
   Hard by the window took her place."-
   Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
   Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
   Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
   Harvests of souls unceasingly
   Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
   Hateful the hollow world became,
   Hath fate apportioned unto thee
   Hath gradually learnt to endure;
   Hath mixed himself in the affair,
   Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
   Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
   Hath she found out the riddle yet?
   Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
   Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
   Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
   Hath whiled the road"s monotony,
   Haughty appear, subservient,
   Have echoed to eternity.
   Have e"er a precious tress consigned,
   Have entered never to return.
   Have felt love"s agitated kiss
   Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
   Have latterly vexatious grown;
   Have one by one all withered grown
   Have shone as one of fashion"s leaders.
   Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
   Having a trusty staff bestowed,
   Having abjured the haunts of men,
   Having for money"s sake alone
   Having lost all in life we prize.
   Having once fixed your interest,
   Having performed his service truly,
   Having remarked Vladimir"s flight,
   Having this mournful document
   He a polite reply doth scrawl.
   He back as from a sudden blow?-
   He bending whispered in her ear
   He bends his course to Talon"s, where
   He "Benedetta" used to hum,
   He bowed to her nor silence broke,
   He brought from mystic Germany
   He called to mind Tattiana"s grace,
   He called upon me Christmas Eve-
   He cannot give me happiness."
   He cared no longer there to stay,
   He conversation would have led-
   He could in disputation shine
   He daily in his drives drew near
   He deemed his coming would inspire
   He deemed his friends but longed to make
   He deemed of human life the goal
   He dragged her by a forest road
   He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
   He drops his pistol silently.
   He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
   He enters. High the cork arose
   He enters: in the hall a crowd,
   He enters: rapidly discussion
   He enters the saloon. "Tis blank!
   He enters: to the mill he drives:
   He eyed her with a fond concern,
   He feared the criminal might try
   He felt the laudable desire
   He finally lost all delight
   He fixedly upon her stares-
   He found him on the table laid,
   He found them in an almanac,
   He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
   He gazed upon the clock which showed
   He had excepted from the ban:
   He has returned, say in what guise?
   He hath acquired the world"s esteem
   "He hath neglected us of late."-
   He heard his soul"s complaint within,
   He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
   He in imagination saw
   He in the early years of life
   He is a charming youth and wise.
   He is not there: I am not known:
   He kindled his poetic flame.
   He knew not how to spend his life.
   He knits his brows-"tis silent all.
   He knows Kaverine will repair.
   He laughs, although it aches from cold,
   He left you first, and I must own
   He leisurely adorns for her.
   He lies, upon his forehead death,
   He long should have been on the road.
   He loved the simpleton to mock,
   He marmot-like did hibernate,
   He might his motives have narrated,
   He mused: "I will her saviour be!
   He nears a spacious mansion"s gate,
   He ne"er shall hear Time"s eulogy,
   He now a full possession takes,
   He obstinately will remain,
   He offers her his murderous paw;
   He oft upon his lips would curb,
   He on his bosom gently placed
   He on the conflagration frowned.
   He ought to have conciliated
   He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
   "He promised here this day to ride,"
   He quits the fashionable throng
   He racked his brains to find its clue
   He read as vainly as before,
   He read the unbelieving Bayle,
   He reads at random, reads in vain.
   He rings in haste; in haste arrives
   He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
   He round the billiard-table stalked,
   He salutary rules poured forth?
   He sang of life"s fresh colours stained
   He sang of love-to love a slave.
   He sang of separation grim,
   He sat, and then the livelong day,
   He seemed for matrimony born.
   He shunned those parties boisterous;
   He smiles, in laughter all combine;
   He somewhat blushing would omit:
   He still made love in a queer way;
   He takes his seat, concludes his game,
   He there is master-that is plain;
   He thought so, and existence charmed.
   He thought to write, but labour long
   He to the festival repairs,
   He took no more the slightest heed;
   He took the room wherein the old
   He used to hate-and was no fool-
   He usually was glad to see
   He wakes-they with a letter come-
   He wanders in his indolence;
   He was a dangerous fool indeed.
   He was a dear delightful fool-
   He was an honest gentleman,
   He was beloved: or say at least,
   He was deceived. Just as before
   He was in error; for Eugene
   He was most gay. The happy date
   He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
   He was no more! The youthful bard
   He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
   He went not-sooner was prepared
   He who economy abhorred,
   He who hath lived and living, thinks,
   He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
   He who life"s frosts which early wrung
   He whom we sing to shall be made
   He will delight you, I am sure,
   He with an innocence extreme
   He with his little maiden played,
   He witnessed tenderly and moved
   He would not that a man ye slay
   He writes upon his parents" tomb,
   He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
   He wrote ("tis the romantic style,
   He yawns, averts his countenance,
   Heard he the truth? And thus she could-
   Hearing the fatal perfidy?
   Hears not my importunity!
   Heart would not throb albeit in jest-
   Heaved an involuntary sigh
   Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
   Heedless of your despairing cry?
   Her agitation and distress
   Her all in all did constitute;
   Her amorous experience
   Her antiquated mode of speech,
   Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
   Her bow was easy, unreserved.
   Her brow she did not e"en contract
   Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
   Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
   Her cheek of rosy loveliness
   Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
   Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
   Her eyes no saucy glance address,
   Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
   Her features no grimaces bleared;
   Her feet the earth beneath her press!
   Her figure perfect grows with time!
   Her foot was in my other hand.
   Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
   Her garden, and those books of hers,
   Her girlish gaiety and sport.
   Her glance how wild yet genial!
   Her Grandison was in the Guard,
   Her hand for the cotillon prays.
   Her handkerchief she loses now;
   Her head upon her breast declines
   Her health, life"s sweetness and its bloom,
   Her heart how full of gentleness,
   Her heart importunately turns.
   Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
   Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
   Her house he enters, ghastly white,
   Her husband was a bridegroom then,
   Her in the pitfalls which we place.
   Her inmost soul had penetrated,
   Her lips where light smiles come and go!
   Her locks were of a golden hue,
   Her manners were deliberate,
   Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
   Her money counted, and designed
   Her Moscow cousin, often told
   Her movements, voice and figure slight,
   Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
   Her on a shaky bench sit down;
   Her passion"s faithful counterpart,
   Her path across the plain doth keep-
   Her promptings unto law did make,
   Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
   Her sentimental verses all,
   Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
   Her shoulder-Olga swiftly came-
   Her shoulders, breast and face to lave-
   Her sisterhood delights the young
   Her smile and maidenly repose,
   Her spacious fields and shady groves,
   Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
   Her suit before my parents pressing:
   Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
   Her tears flow plentifully and
   Her the ideal which he dreamed,
   Her toilette"s antiquated style,
   Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
   Her utterances ever heard,
   Her weary eyes are filled with tears-
   Her with a smile old women greet,
   Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
   Herds low, and under night"s dark veil
   Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
   Here bottles stand in close array,
   Here, drunk with his late victory,
   "Here, he resides with Simeon.
   Here I remark all poets are
   Herein my portrait should detect,
   Herself not knowing well the reason,
   He"s a freemason, so we think.
   He"s a straightforward little chap."
   Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
   Hid in the gondola"s dark shade,
   Highways all Russia will unite
   Him a disquietude did seize,
   Him who inspired both love and awe,
   Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
   Himself transformed into a hack;
   His ardent soul with full delight.
   His arm he offers. Mute and sad
   His bit with foam besprinkled o"er,
   His book-shelf instantly doth drape
   His breast was riddled through and through,
   His butting horns in anger bent,
   His care unto his pistols" plight,
   His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
   His chambers close wherein confined
   His character attracted me.
   His comedies, a noisy rout,
   His constant soul could ever tire,
   His course unto the running brook.
   His cup unto his maiden dear.
   His daily occupations, lo!
   His daughter"s book to ascertain
   His ditties were as pure and bright
   His double sashes and his grate,
   His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
   His energy and impotence.
   His entrance with Onéguine. "Ah!
   His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
   His fate shall presently decide.
   His fist Onéguine fiercely shook
   His footing on the treacherous rime
   His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
   His friends and also enemies
   His friendship I acquired just then;
   His furs are powdered on the way
   His gusts should fertilize, amend,
   His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
   His harp beneath that sky had rung
   His hate by slander, and who spends
   His head sinks slowly, rests upon
   His heart reciprocated still
   His Hellespont from bank to bank,
   His housekeeper was wont to scold,
   His immorality of mind
   His inner consciousness laid bare,
   His intellect in close array.
   His kneeling posture he retains-
   His lyre, to silence now consigned,
   His malady, whose cause I ween
   His momentary loving glance
   His mother from the door doth scold.
   His mournful heart no peace could find,
   His name: the tenderness of home
   His neighbour"s lowly tomb and mourned
   His own antagonists expert,
   His pony sniffing the fresh snows
   His recent glory he invokes.
   His relative and friend as well.
   His ruffian bravery adored,
   His shop, a night-cap on his head,
   His son and mortgages his lands.
   His son is married, just conceive!"
   His song, when still he slumbered deep,
   His soul by crash of music fired,
   His spirit sank with strange delight.
   His spirit was intent upon.
   His sunken eye and aspect faint,
   His tea with rum no more desired,
   His transports were quite maidenly,
   His travels like all other things
   His uncle, busy man indeed,
   His valet brings him letters three.
   His vanity first let us pique
   His visit she had not awaited,
   His wadded coat and cap with peak
   His watch, the sun in turn he views-
   His weary head declined at rest,
   His wife approaches, with him leads
   His wife was also mad upon
   Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
   Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
   Homeward returning, he at home
   Honour and pride inflexible.
   Hope to conceal and jealousy,
   Hope with her fascinating power
   Hopeless are all the first, I own,
   Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
   Horror! had she not better stay
   Horror of sinfulness and shame,
   "How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
   How artless was the note which spoke
   How bitterly he would malign,
   How bright and tender was his look,
   "How came you then to wed a man?"-
   How charming Olga"s shoulders grow!
   How dark the night is getting though!
   How deftly could he transport feign!
   "How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
   How empires store of wealth unfold,
   How flourish, why and wherefore less
   How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"-
   How full of fire his speech would glow!
   How I have erred and felt the rod!
   How in the country pass this time?
   How like a poet was my chum
   How like the billow I desired
   How mean, how pusillanimous!
   How meekly then I heard you preach-
   How much is in that word expressed!
   "How now, Onéguine, yawning still?"-
   How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
   How oft the kindly Muse away
   How oft to the Crimean shore
   How oft, when on a summer night
   "How often in thine arms I lay;
   How perfect doth our epoch grow!
   How pleasantly the evening jogs
   How sick to death his uncle lay
   How soon he learnt deception"s art,
   How soon he learnt to titillate
   How soon to habits she conformed
   How sweet a dream your memories raise!
   "How Tania grows! Doth it appear
   How the young imp on Tania doted!
   How thoroughly her part she took!
   How thy hands burn!"-"Dear nurse, I"m well.
   How well he played the greenhorn"s part
   How with thy medal I would play,
   However cherries might abound,
   However, Tania"s letter reading,
   However, the mazurka lacks
   Howl like a dolt: "tis meant for me!
   Hung like a print against the wall,
   Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
   Hurrah! it long ago was time!
   Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
   Hymen"s embarrassments, distress,
   I, after so much eloquence,
   I also wandered there of old,
   I am acquainted with fresh care,
   "I am in love," her whispers tell
   I am in love, my hour hath come!
   "I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
   I am not strong enough to state;
   I am not worthy them in aught;
   I am-in love-you know-don"t tell!"
   I Apuleius gladly read
   I ask, all ye who poets are,
   I blame not your behaviour-
   I by the button-hole seize fast
   "I call to witness God on high-"
   I cannot help it I declare,
   I cannot longer wage concealed.
   I cannot tell on what pretence-
   I cannot tell the reason why,
   I cannot understand. But lo!
   I can"t conceive a little dear
   I can"t translate the adjective.
   "I celebrate a comrade young
   I did not please you. Why pursue
   I envied sore the billows tall,
   I feel, allotted is my span;
   I feel thou wast by God sent down
   I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
   I formerly admired her much
   I guard it as a holy thing,
   I had found my predestinate,
   I have dreamed many a vision fair
   I have endured without respite.
   I have it. Lo! the very thing!
   I have known beauties cold and raw
   I have no leisure here to dwell,
   I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
   I heard thy voice"s resonance
   I just hint, in parenthesis,
   I know not if his heart felt pain
   I know that Parny"s tender pen
   I know there"s none more amiable.
   I lift a warning voice because
   I like the difference to express
   I like this word exceedingly
   I long by ballets have been bored,
   I long enough deceived have erred.
   I long have ceased to offend the laws.
   I love its furious delight,
   I love them, O my dear Elvine,
   I love you with a brother"s love,
   I love you-to what end deceive?-
   I loved you-what did I obtain?
   I married-now, I supplicate-
   I mean my name not to repeat."
   I might to connoisseurs repeat
   I mourn, but tears I cannot shed-
   I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
   I mused: perhaps the matter"s squared-
   I must resign myself, in sooth;
   I never should have seen your face
   I on my chosen hero dote;
   I once forgot for your sweet cause
   I owe the censorship a little.
   I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
   I promised!-Did I so?-Well, there!
   I sail upon my lake at times
   I say without poetic phrase,
   I see you weep. Those tears of yours
   "I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
   I should alarm our friendship tried:
   I slumber much, a little read,
   (I speak not of our poems here),
   I still a complication view,
   I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
   I thank thee. In thy company,
   I the same admonition make.
   I then resolved my heart to tear;
   I thought-retirement, liberty,
   I tremble lest my humble prayer
   I tried when I began this tale,
   I uttered to my lady fair
   I was for calm existence made,
   I was half silly with affright.
   I was incensed and he was sad.
   "I weep. And if within your breast
   I will descant on love"s sweet dream,
   I will not wed, and ever weeps
   I will with thy divinity
   "I with my friend intend to fight!"
   "I won"t detain you; but "tis hard
   I would desire my bride to be-
   I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
   I would not part with finally;
   I would your vigilance arouse,
   I write, and anguish flies away,
   I write to you! Is more required?
   I yield for splendid vanities,
   I yield the fruit of work severe.
   I yield with a low reverence;
   "Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
   "Ideas and time ne"er backward move;
   Ideas, desires and woes confuse
   Idolatry of liberty,

   If he had only known the wound
   If his hot hand encountered hers,
   If in the scenes of home I might
   If not, the money I will lend."
   If Olga smilingly approve,
   If seriously he hath disease;
   If the choice in my power were,
   "If the domestic hearth could bless-
   If the fond hope I could have fanned
   If the poor maiden could have guessed
   If the raw product they possess
   If they but heard domestic loads

   I"m not for witchcraft now inclined.

   Imagination"s sacred fires,
   Imagine! Here alone am I!
   Immersed in melancholy thought,
   Immersed in secret thought I stand
   Impatient, boiling o"er with wrath,
   Impatient waits the close of day,
   Impatiently the gallery stamps,
   Impelled by Spring"s dissolving beams,
   Impelled by zeal for moral worth,

   In a lax or informal way,
   In age the memory gets worse,
   In aimless ease and far from strife,
   In amorous flights when so inspired,
   In books he saw nought to condemn

   In bud of promise incomplete,
   In bullets, sabres, and in fight.

   In horror for itself alone,
   In idleness and tranquil joy
   In jersey and in nightcap lay.

   In little maidens of thirteen?
   In love adventures she was versed,
   In love, although its tempests vex,
   In love-lorn meditation sad.

   In many things had changed his life-
   In melancholy loveliness,
   In mist profound all yet is hid.
   In monsters and fair dames was rich;
   In mother Winter"s strange caprice.
   In motley and amusing chase.
   In much his conduct stigmatized;
   In mud and mire to wallow deep,
   In my young days of wild delight
   In old age life is weariness!"
   In Olga"s album, youthful maid,
   In Olga"s and Tattiana"s rooms
   In Olga"s face no life"s displayed.
   In one great shout: she"s mine! she"s mine!
   In one he doth accounts behold,
   In one of thine enchanting lays
   In one thing really did excel.
   In order due the maidens pull;
   In pages of a love narration
   In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
   In rhyming I show laziness.
   In Russ her love made manifest,
   In scarlet cap revolving glides.
   In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
   In scenes like these it may be though,
   In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
   In serious mood or dalliance
   In silence shall I sit and yawn
   In snow she sinks up to the knee;
   In solid, unpretentious style,
   In solitude or worldly din,
   In some a willing martyrdom.
   In spectacles and chestnut wig.
   In spite of common sense we"re wont
   In spring-time, heard the cygnet"s note
   In springtime on the meadows green,

   In Tania"s praise in pouch he brought,
   In that morass where you and I
   In the beginning, cold and mute,
   In the beginning of this lay,
   In the broad meadow a gay rout,
   In the dawn of existence drear.
   In the first place, say, am I right?
   In the French language perfectly,

   In their sterility of prattle,

   In winter by its blank and dim
   In winter on the fender bright,

   Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
   Maid whom my heart desires alone,
   Maidens before her meekly move
   Maids in the corner whisper low;
   Make up your mind to go there."-"Ah!
   Malek Adel and De Linar,
   Malicious and a slanderer.
   Malignant fury they disclose,
   Man-forty years long in this wise-
   Many an ancient legend which
   Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
   Mark ye with what a modest air
   Marmontel also, tome the third;
   Matrons unto the fireplace go,
   May be, and this my terror wakes,
   May be that I by heaven"s decrees
   May be the empire of the sense,
   May find a crumb to satisfy.
   May well in innocence impart.
   May yet be studious of his nails;
   Me now, inflict upon me pain?-
   Me your perfections would not bless;
   Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
   Meagre, within a draughty hut,
   Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
   Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
   Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
   Meantime I"ll finish whilst I can

   Meeting you in times past by chance,

   Men love no more, as only the
   Men opposite. The cross they sign

   Method was dear unto his heart
   Metreless verses recognizing
   "Me?"-"Yes! It is Tattiana"s fête
   "Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
   "Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
   Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
   Minutely I will now portray.
   Miraculously fair arise,
   Misunderstanding, words and blows.
   Modest yet daring! And a tear
   Moina recalls for this alone
   Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
   "Monsieur l"Abbé" a starving Gaul,
   Morality taught scarce at all;
   More advantageously appear
   More blooming than the Boreal flame
   More clearly, God be praised, the man,
   More crimson every moment they.
   More satisfaction to her taste.
   More swift the room Tattiana fled,
   More timid than a doe long chased,
   More troublesome than usual?"-"No!
   Morning awakes with joyous sound;
   Morning"s forerunners, breezes blow
   Mortally sick I am indeed.
   Moscow
   Moscow approach on bended knees,
   Moscow! How much is in the phrase
   Moscow, how oft in evil days,
   Moscow, Russia"s darling daughter,
   Moscow"s young Graces at her stare,
   Most by this circumstance offended
   Most carefully Zaretski placed
   Most usually a Cossack horse
   Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
   Mountains we"ll level and through deep
   Mournful is thine approach to me,
   Mournful Love"s deadly trace appears
   Mushrooms for winter salted down,
   Must be pronounced unfortunate-
   Must bow in common courtesy;
   Must e"en despise his kind at last;
   Must now my stanzas occupy.
   Must take a walk and rest a bit-
   Must visit them. Come! you must own,
   Mute glances interchanged aside
   Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
   Mutual destruction to contrive.
   Mutual repulsion and ennui,
   My beauty, thou art ready too.
   "My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
   My country and an exile"s lot;
   My country"s honour and repute
   "My darling child, thou art in pain.-
   "My darling, growing old am I!
   My days of life approach their end,
   My doom has been pronounced on high,
   My famous portrait indicate
   My friend, "tis but to pay a debt,
   My friends, the poet ye regret!
   My friends, what means this odd digression?
   My frivolous and jolly youth.
   My goddesses, where are your shades?
   My gratitude do not disdain,
   My guardian angel to the grave.
   My heart of old would captivate.
   My heart with but one look revive;
   My heart"s allegiance can resign,
   "My heart"s delight, thou art not well."-
   My heroine, Tattiana dear.
   My image hath not disappeared,
   My joy in youth was fleeting e"en
   My light productions to retain,
   My little book. With thee I knew
   My lot is fixed-with thoughtlessness
   My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
   My memory wandered wide and sought
   My morning birdie, yesternight
   My mother-in-law who lately died
   My mournful fate in verse to weave,
   My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
   My pen no longer finds delight,
   My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
   My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
   My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
   My pretty self-deceiving maid-
   My scholar without aptitude
   "My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
   My soul I cannot renovate-
   My soul is filled with gratitude!
   My spirit and my blood doth move,
   My spirit with such pangs before.
   My splendid house and gaieties-
   My sportive Muse I used to take
   My sum of happiness contained;
   My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
   "My uncle"s goodness is extreme,
   My unpretending page shall fill,
   My venerated reader, oh!
   My verses, kindly meant, would earn
   My very latest composition!
   My word of honour given have I.
   My wretched Lenski"s fate I mourn,
   Mysteriously all objects near
   Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
   Napoleon tarried till it please
   Nasce una gente a cui "l morir non duole."
   Nay! even as this instant fled,
   Nay, near-but destiny decreed-
   Near Khariton"s in a side street
   Near young Tattiana resident,
   Nearer they come-Eugene appears!
   Nearest and dearest knew not how
   Ne"er touched her fingers indolent
   Ne"er trusted to the treacherous ace.
   Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
   Never for me to reappear-
   Never upon my heroine
   Next Saturday. The Làrina
   Night separated from her spouse,
   No answer all that day was borne.
   No answer! He another sent.
   No coquetry was there, I vouch-
   No, ever to behold your face,
   No fond illusions live to soothe,
   No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
   No greater pleasure can exist
   No longer through her former home;
   "No matter, look immediately.
   "No misery I see in that"-
   No more at dawn the shepherd will
   No more remembered him; unto
   No more the music thunders loud,
   No more the village knows his face,
   No more with pale Diana"s rays,
   No, never in the early blaze
   No novelty-is it not true?-
   No obstacle of which I know.
   No one appeared to lend a hand.
   No one my anguish comprehends,
   No one the contrary will urge,
   No other book had time to read.
   No other than Onéguine mine.
   No sense was ever manifest
   No senseless fashionable lay
   No signs of trouble her accused,
   No time to pick it up! afraid,
   No trace ye left in passing by
   Noblesse and models of the mode,
   Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
   None, be my witness Heaven above!
   None could a trace of that impute,
   None could her beautiful declare,
   None the conviction could withstand
   (Nonsense and pure absurdity,
   Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
   Nor at the hour of noon with sound
   Nor aught confides unto the rest.
   Nor beauties of far distant lands
   Nor boston nor the world"s affairs
   Nor by her beauty she became
   Nor by her sister"s brilliancy
   Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
   Nor dares the skirting of her dress
   Nor did her blushes fade away,
   Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
   Nor discontinued to distress
   Nor doth my absent pen portray
   Nor enough strength of mind possessed
   Nor even tears afford respite,
   Nor frigid adulation paid.
   Nor from the mob polite estranged,
   Nor further comment that night made.
   Nor homage which the Muse demands
   Nor in his dreams anticipates
   Nor interest in aught betrays.
   Nor long his mind was agitated
   Nor marked how summer"s prime had fled
   Nor on the letter yet hath she
   Nor precepts sage nor pictures e"en,
   Nor shall my pen paint terribly
   Nor shall the bud of yesterday
   Nor shall the caterpillar come
   Nor slander viciously could spread
   Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
   Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
   Nor sudden turned she red or white,
   Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
   Nor the first snow of winter seize
   Nor the frost particles inhale
   Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
   Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
   Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
   Nor years of separation all
   Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
   Not a bad fellow was her father
   Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
   Not agony, but death expressed.
   Not all will like myself proceed-
   Not, and a flood of bitter tears
   "Not at all."-"That I can"t conceive!
   Not bristled up like a wild beast,
   Not daring to cast back her eyes.
   Not even a poetic phrase,
   Not high in general estimation;
   "Not in the least, assured am I!"-
   Not knowing its interpretation,
   Not only sorrow-Ah! my dear,
   Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
   Not so! My Moscow never went
   Not that she had his works perused,
   Not the least trace Onéguine sees
   Not the young timid maid, believe,
   Not to behave as he did once-
   "Nothing, good nurse, there"s nothing wrong,
   Nought but of dinners a long row,
   Nought from his pen did ever flow,
   Nought in the universe refused:
   Nought of its charms original
   November at the gate did stand.
   Now a long branch itself entwined
   Now all things round about repeat
   Now, as in a deserted house,
   Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
   Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"
   Now don"t be cross with me, my soul,
   Now for the first time I my Muse
   Now for the jealous youth what joy!
   Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
   Now her lithe form she arches o"er
   Now I am fit for nothing here.
   Now I am ready to refuse.
   Now it is ready to be sent-
   Now, like hereditary foes,
   Now of a family the head,
   Now talkative, now reticent;
   Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
   Now we must separate. Good-bye!
   Now with what eager interest
   "Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
   "Nurse, "tis so close I cannot rest.
   Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
   O Brenta, once more we shall meet
   O epic Muse, my powers increase
   O feet, where"er your path extends
   O Men, how very like ye are
   "O Rus!"-Horace
   O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
   O triumphs of my guileless days,
   O ye whom tender love hath pained
   O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
   Obedient she had ever been
   Obedient then to Nature"s law,
   Obedient to the magic strings,
   Obedient to warm Spring"s commands.
   Obeyed the impulses of heart?-
   Oblivion of life"s tempest dire,
   Obsequious or indifferent!
   Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
   O"er all a sheet of silvery dust
   O"er hillock and o"er meadow throws.
   O"er my remains to drop a tear,
   O"erspread with Winter"s carpet bright,
   O"erwhelmed with guests; by families
   Of a heart cold and cynical?
   Of a most mournful episode,
   Of a strange night when the moon and-
   Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
   Of affectation innocent,
   Of Africa, ancestral land,
   Of all the guests within his mind.
   Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
   Of censure for the same incurred;
   Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
   Of churches, gardens, belfries high
   Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
   Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
   Of "comme il faut." Shishkòff, forgive!
   Of consolation all bereft-
   Of conversation, thought and aims-
   Of course Tattiana was annoyed
   Of creditors a hungry rout
   Of diplomats and warlike beaux
   Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
   Of dreary Russia left behind,
   Of error and the passions" strife.
   Of every sort and every set!"-
   Of fashionable dames the foe,
   Of fiery youth"s untutored days
   Of fleeting glory take no heed.
   Of foreign whims the impersonation-
   Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
   Of friends the grateful intercourse-
   Of friends unceremonious would
   Of frivolous existence, friends;
   Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
   Of harmony enshrining thought.
   Of her provincial innocence
   Of his approach; but nothing cared
   Of horn in circle call them round.
   Of keen sarcastic intellect
   Of kindly, dim antiquity,
   Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
   Of languor and of love did tell
   Of late I have been quite absurd,-
   Of Levshin"s school ye followers,
   Of life or death predestinate.
   Of London life is "vulgar" called
   Of love again, and yet again;
   Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
   Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
   Of many an economic scheme;
   Of migratory gipsy hordes-
   Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
   Of modern Russians the disease.
   Of my impassioned heroine.
   Of my light paramour was proud.
   Of old maids the divinity,
   Of Olga he in song averred;
   Of one thing till again we met.
   Of passion reminiscences,
   Of passion they so often raise.
   Of pictures painful harrowing,
   Of priceless value all things seem
   Of roses to romancers dear;
   Of rural life the sluggish stream;
   Of Russian domesticity;
   Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
   Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
   Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
   Of such a dread hallucination.
   Of sunset glow with rosy light,
   Of tender years the modesty
   Of thankless friends the circle rose,
   Of the commencement of the piece.
   Of the cup brimming o"er with wine-
   Of the domains of the side-scene.
   Of the horizon she is like!"-
   Of the imperial Neva"s shore.
   Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
   Of the night sentinels arise
   Of the romances she preferred,
   Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
   Of the Tattiana of times fled.
   Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
   Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
   Of thy delights I drank my fill,
   Of touching lightly every theme.
   Of untold gain she must conceal,
   Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
   Of what he thought and what believed,
   Of what not, and of distant dim,
   Of which the rustling woods remind?
   Of whirligigs were very fond,
   Of widow Clicquot or Moet
   Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
   Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
   Of your perfections in my soul,
   Of youthful impulse, reverie,
   Oft staring through the window pane
   Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
   "Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
   Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
   "Oh! how our years are vanishing!"
   Oh! I accept. And instantly
   "Oh! I remember, where is he?"-
   Oh, many a year hath run its course
   "Oh! nurse, nurse, you don"t understand!
   Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
   "Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
   Oh! what had been his eminence!
   Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
   "Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
   Oh! who her speechless agonies
   Oh! who is not calumnious?
   Old age through spectacles too peers,
   Old people"s simple conversations
   Old women at the coachmen swear.
   Olga and Tania led. Malign,
   Olga began to long likewise
   Olga he sees before his eyes
   Olga ran skipping from the door.
   Olga the tea must supervise-
   Olga with trepidation dire.
   Olga"s admirer came that day:
   "Olinka is her junior, see.
   Ombre, and whist all others worth:
   Omens inspired her soul with fear,
   On balls I madly used to dote,
   On chairs in the saloon reposed,
   On everything around her gaze,
   On fresh allurements they are bent,
   On guests their servants used to wait
   On him spleen mounted sentinel
   On horseback every day they ride-
   On horseback gallop o"er the steppe!
   On innocent delights I dote,
   On iron bridges we shall gaze
   On Lenski"s matrimonial fate
   On lines invisible are fixt;
   On melted wax in water poured;
   On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
   On raptures, sorrows not her own,
   On such a day. O Heavens, "tis she!
   On Sundays by yon window he,
   On sunny days the glistening rime,
   On the blue blocks of ice the rays
   On the dull stage find all things changed,
   On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
   On thee I used to meditate!
   On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
   On this artistical retreat
   On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
   On unknown female forms he throws.
   On us beyond the grave attends,
   On waves by tempests curdled o"er!
   On whom a sister"s heart was set
   On winters of the south a skit,
   Once more to idleness consigned,
   Once more, when she appeared in sight,
   (One and the same thing it may be)
   One image occupied his mind,
   One instrument for his own use-
   One moment"s slumber suffer not.
   One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
   Only her countenance assumed
   Onéguine acted very well
   "Onéguine, all this sumptuousness,
   Onéguine, bored to death again,
   Onéguine, by first impulse moved,
   Onéguine could not now submit,
   Onéguine fired-Alas! alas!
   Onéguine, hast forgotten yet
   Onéguine his excuses says;
   "Onéguine, I was younger then,
   Onéguine knew enough, the rogue
   Onéguine lightning glances shot;
   Onéguine meditative stood,
   Onéguine ne"er as poet showed
   Onéguine, O my gentle readers,
   Onéguine Olga bore away.
   Onéguine oped the cupboards wide.
   Onéguine sat the table by
   Onéguine slowly then began
   Onéguine then approached and said:
   Onéguine to the window went
   Onéguine waits on us, "tis like."
   Onéguine was a citizen
   Onéguine was the most impressed,
   Onéguine was-so many deemed
   Onéguine wasted; on my word,
   Onéguine went with trepidation
   Onéguine whither gallops? Ye
   Onéguine"s cheek grew ashy pale,
   Onéguine"s Letter to Tattiana
   Onéguine"s letter!"-"Ah! the thing!
   Onéguine"s pencillings. His mind
   Onéguine"s speeches I abhorred
   Onéguine-take him up again-
   Onéguine-the beloved place
   Open the window-sit by me."
   Opened the portals of the tomb
   Opened with care, and entering bore
   Openly or "neath decent cloak.
   Opens unto her visitor.

   Our paradise is no more sweet.
   Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
   Our tender dreamer had enrolled
   Our union would produce but grief.
   Our youthful wanderer should roam.
   Ourselves as unities to count;
   Outlandish and provincial,

   Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"-
   Permit me; is it worth the trouble
   Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
   Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
   Pervaded with much common sense.
   Perverse, unfavourable views?

   Remained unnoticed. Once he went
   Remained with him the youthful maid.
   Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
   Remarkable. She then indeed
   Removed her to his country seat,
   Renowned for his acumen, wit,
   Repentance wields not now her spell
   Replace the visions fancy drew;
   Replaced them in their box, undressed
   Repose from labour, satire keen,
   Repose her silken curtains fled,
   Repose in peace, thou child of song."
   Rescue me from oblivion.
   Reserved, but not inanimate,
   Resolved the flirt to cast away,
   Resounding through all ages might
   Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
   Restrained the impulses of youth;
   Retained the image, though short-lived,
   Returning, from his ship amid
   Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
   Reviews both dress and countenance,
   Right opposite Tattiana placed,
   Rings from a dish of water full
   Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
   Rogue and extortioner of yore,
   Romance of love I pray refer,
   Romances pleased her from the first,
   Romances three, in which ye scan
   Rooted unto the spot remained.
   Round which revolves the universe.
   Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
   Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
   Rural Life
   Russia"s Terpsichore review
   Said something in an undertone
   Sailed silently in unison-
   Sails her allotted course on high,
   Saint Priest, who every album"s page
   Sang childhood"s pastimes and its joy,
   Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
   Satan will jest, and at love"s cost.
   Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
   "Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
   Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
   Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
   Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
   Scarce to her questions he responds,
   Scarcely in Russia can ye find
   Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
   Scissors both straight and curved as well,
   Scornfully challenged you afield-
   Seated, a curious look with glasses
   Secret excursions made in sleighs;
   Secure in rural quietude-
   Sed alia tempora. And bravery
   Seductive, animated, bright,
   Seductive cup of love, whose flow
   See, I can hardly crawl about-
   (See the first canto if ye will),
   Seeing in this no deprivation,
   Seek the forgotten countenance
   Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
   Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
   Seems so unnatural and absurd:
   Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
   Sees where a noble mansion stood,
   Selfish nonentities around?
   Serious endeavours to assure
   Servant of God and brigadier,
   Serve who could neither read nor write.
   Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
   Shaking with serious air the head,
   Shall abdicate the bard"s profession,
   Shall I behold thee once again?"-
   "Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
   Shall I your chorus hear anew,
   Shall my declining years beguile;
   Shall surely, be it soon or late,
   "Shall we commence?"-"Let it be so,"
   Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
   Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
   She bows her head beneath the crown;
   She brought with her the gift of song.
   She buries deep within her breast
   She calm and unconcerned appears.
   She cannot draw a breath or stir.
   She cannot-Eugene oped the door
   She cannot-then impatiently
   She comprehends. The simple maid
   She consolation thence obtained-
   She could not sleep in her new bed.
   She deemed its outline might afford.
   She did not think "procrastination
   She dreamt she journeyed o"er a field
   She drinks in those seductive deeds!
   She enters a deserted yard-
   She fears and like an arrow rushes
   She fears she cannot.-Cannot? Why?-
   She found herself alone at last,
   She from the winter corn espies
   She gazed around her-it was day.
   She gazed thereon, and instant beat
   She gazed-a cue, forgotten long,
   She got a book of nursery tales,
   She heard of servant-maids the note,
   She hears of conversation nought
   She hears the bear behind her press,
   She heaves a sigh and deep intent
   She hesitates, in doubt is thrown-
   She hid the trouble of her breast,
   She is an angel! We sometime
   She led me through nocturnal mist
   She leisurely away doth ride,
   She loved upon the balcony
   She mourned and to the moon would raise
   She murmurs in an undertone
   She muses: "What was Olga"s fate?
   She ne"er repeated unto hers.
   She nerves herself from her alarm
   She never more his face may view,
   She never of deception dreamed
   She on the apparition gazed,
   She oped her eyes and cried: "tis he!
   She peeped through a chink of the door.
   She promised Eugene, or she would
   She rose-departed. But Eugene
   She runs, the bear upon her trail,
   She sank.-
   She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
   She seeks the garden in her need-
   She seemed of him oblivious,
   She sits alone-"tis ever she!
   She soon forgot, began to call
   She starts, nor doth a word express,
   She strains her throat to force a cry-
   She struggled hard at first thus pent,
   She, than the morning moon more pale,
   She the acquaintances she loves,
   She the delicious novel reads,
   She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
   She trembled and grew deadly pale.
   She visited the humble tents
   She waited for-I don"t know whom!
   She waits, on fire her trembling frame-
   She wanders aimless as a sprite,
   She was as heedless and as gay-
   She was thus fond of Richardson
   "She who with melancholy face
   She will not see, she will not hear.
   She wore her corset tightly bound,
   She would pronounce à la Française;
   Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
   Shines in the female firmament
   Shone pungent Satire"s dauntless king,
   Should be respected throughout life
   Should dearly like a dance again.
   Should go, the market for a maid,
   Should make me much more circumspect,
   Should recompense his idle jeers,
   Shouts, laughter, jamming "gainst the wall,
   Shouts of applause! Onéguine passes
   Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
   Shy, silent did the maid appear
   Sickness more courage doth command
   Sighs on another than her lord
   Silent, oracular ye"d see him
   Silk tapestry upon the wall,
   Silvers the brook; the shepherd"s horn
   Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
   Similar dames ye may have seen.
   Simple and kindly and unwed,
   Since Eugene in that solitude
   Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
   Since I beheld Eugene and young
   Since in these arms I thee did bear-
   Since leisure was together spent,
   Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
   Sincerely loving him, Eugene
   Singing God knows what maid admired,
   Singing in chorus all the while.
   Singing inside her hut the maid
   "Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
   Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
   Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
   Sits down and gazes on all sides-
   Sledging, the snows, which at the time
   Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
   Slept o"er the river misty grown.
   Slow circling round its fellow swings
   Slowly exhausted by desire,
   Slumber still o"er him lingering flies.
   Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
   Snorts, and his rider bends his course
   So ancient warriors, battles o"er,
   So ardently did I desire
   So be it! But internal strife
   So be it! Just the laws which bid
   So frequently his mind would stray
   So from the mountain lazily
   So full of piety, correct,
   So hearken, every worthy spouse,
   So inaccessible to men,
   So irremissible appear?
   So let us to the ball-room haste,
   So many neighbours here exist-
   So meantime let him joyous live
   So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit-
   So prudent, and so circumspect
   So she her silken sash unlaced,
   So she in French herself expressed.
   So Tania to her heart"s content
   So there will be a dance to-night.
   "So thou art wed! I did not know.
   (So "twas with us in former years,
   So uncongenial to my mind,
   So, when he came next day to call,
   Society endures not such!
   Society he duped enow."
   Society renounced once more.
   Sombre or glad in turn to be,
   Some a mazurka occupies,
   Some are afar and some are dead.
   Some army poet therein may
   Some day I"ll somehow finish it.
   Some future ignoramus shall
   Some madrigal not worth a rush,
   Some marriageable maids behold,
   Some nice instructive novel read,
   Some one or other editor
   Some other long-departed Spring,
   Some Russian authors he perused-
   Some wretched journal in his hand;
   Sometime collected, shall relate
   Sometimes by pleasing flattery"s art,
   Sometimes by ready-made despair;
   Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
   Soon Olga"s accents shrill resound
   Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
   Sorrow to counterfeit and wail-
   Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
   Spanned the unbridled torrent o"er;
   Spare yourself unavailing pain
   Spared him not their asperities.
   Spectacles upon nose, all day
   Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
   Speech was so tame and colourless
   Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
   Spite of herself with Lenski"s lot
   Spoiled children most degenerate
   Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
   Spring summons you to her green bowers,
   Spring"s paramour, pours forth her song
   Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
   Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
   Stately, devoid of prejudice,
   Sterner solicitudes engage,
   Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
   Still certain authors, I may add,
   Still doth the misanthrope appear?
   Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
   Still everywhere, without, within,
   Still happier he who ne"er hath known!
   Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
   Still of his club he member was-
   Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
   Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
   Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
   Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
   Stood as estranged from all aloof,
   Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
   Stops at the tomb in passing by;
   Straight for the entrance then he made
   Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
   Straight from their province had he come?"-
   Strange unto her each childish game,
   Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
   Strictly the Carnival observed,
   Striking the intellect with awe
   Struck Lenski dead-across the scene
   Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o"er.
   Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
   Submissive as if in a swoon,
   Subscribed, toujours à vous, Annette;
   Successfully to please her tried,
   Such am I. This did ye expect,
   Such is the country custom good;
   Such open-hearted innocence.
   Such was Onéguine"s sainted life,
   Such were the musings of Eugene.
   Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
   Suddenly to the left hand side,
   Suitable for this semi-Russian.
   Surely ye all have overhauled
   (Surely you know him as I speak);
   Surveying them, she thus doth say:
   Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
   Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
   Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
   Sweet to behold him obstinate,
   Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
   Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
   Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
   Take to their wings and fly away.
   Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
   Tania doth by the casement linger
   "Tania, my eldest child, you know"-
   Tania, observed by nobody,
   Tania the meaning would obtain
   Tania well nigh expired when he
   Tattiana as enchanted stood;
   Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
   Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick-
   Tattiana by a poor aunt"s side,
   Tattiana certainly infers
   Tattiana courage doth regain
   Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
   Tattiana doth accept his aid;
   Tattiana every day conferred
   Tattiana faltered, and became
   Tattiana finds in loneliness.
   Tattiana from the hill descends
   Tattiana gazed with curious eye
   Tattiana gazes on the moon,
   Tattiana gently led them there.
   Tattiana in a misty dream,
   Tattiana in despair unfeigned
   Tattiana in the yard appears
   Tattiana in the young princess!
   Tattiana in traditions old
   Tattiana learns the intelligence-
   Tattiana loved as when a lad,
   Tattiana moans and now she sighs
   Tattiana more than ever burned
   Tattiana motionless abides.
   Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
   Tattiana o"er the stream complained;
   Tattiana purchased with a stray
   Tattiana, Russian to the core,
   Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"-
   Tattiana saw with trepidation
   Tattiana suffered secretly;
   Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
   Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
   Tattiana terrified awoke.
   Tattiana thanks to all returned,
   Tattiana through the forest erred,
   Tattiana to a corner, bids
   Tattiana to the index flies
   Tattiana waits. No answer came!
   Tattiana was her appellation.
   Tattiana with impatience waited
   Tattiana would attempt to fly,
   Tattiana would have gladly heard
   Tattiana"s beauty, pale with care,
   Tattiana"s eyes with tender gleam
   Tattiana"s letter I possess,
   Tattiana"s Letter to Onéguine
   Tattiana"s love was quite sincere,
   Tattiana"s trouble might have spied,
   Tattiana-thus the sex is born.-
   Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
   Tell me, of sentiments concealed
   "Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
   Tend not my heart to mitigate,
   Tender and elevated, free?
   Terpsichore alone among
   Terrible tales she loved to hear.
   Terror assails her. Hastily
   Terror of guardians of the night;
   Than cold Onéguine"s oddities,
   Than health, so with a trembling hand
   Than one"s own fascinating self.
   That a friend"s arm in every case
   That afterwards with evil smile
   That all may hear his voice"s tone.
   That bilberry wine, I"m sore afraid,
   That certain volumes she might read.
   That chosen heroes consecrate,
   That crass stupidity misleads,
   That every morn at Verrey"s cost
   That first the Muse appeared to me.
   That for that matter in my verse
   That, for the century designed,
   That girl whom once on a time he
   That girl-but he must dreaming be-
   That glimmered through the radiant night
   That grandmothers and grandsires may
   That guests approach: and when above
   That he was "ready any day."
   That heart with inspiration sweet
   That Heaven her character had blent
   That hero, though his merit shone,
   That I am rich, a prince"s wife?-
   That I forget not whom I sing.
   That I to you reveal my mind?
   That is, he could elucidate
   That like a friendly voice its tone
   That mediocrity alone
   That mind which yearns for space is bound?
   That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
   That my dishonour would ensure
   That Nina"s marble symmetry,
   That our desires which noblest seemed,
   That rascal Lovelace she abused;
   That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
   That the two friends with morning"s light
   That, tipsy once in actual fight,
   That until Christmas comes again
   That vanished are my youthful days
   That vicious set whom I don"t blame-
   That we by cant ourselves deceive,
   That we her constantly betrayed
   That year the autumn season late
   That youthful heart-"But, now at least,
   The accents wild of other"s woes,
   The aged mother, bathed in tears,
   The aged nurse in ample gown,
   The aged woman in her woe:
   The all-entrancing joys of love-
   The altar flame was quenched in night.
   The amatory science warm,
   The ancient barshtchina replaced
   The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
   The artful prisoner should seek
   The artifice of villany-
   The aspect of a landscape drear.
   The avalanche of snow first bends,
   The ball in all its splendour shone.
   The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
   The bard his answer waits at home,
   The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
   The bard"s enthusiastic strain,
   The bath on Saturdays attended,
   The bays of age and helplessness.
   The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
   The bee forth from his cell of wax
   The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
   The blessings of humanity.
   The blood boiled and the passions strove.
   The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
   The body they consigned to rest,
   The boy was wild but full of grace.
   The break of day she doth not see,
   The breath of Spring again renewed,
   The bridegroom sage without delay
   The bridge and alley to the lake,
   The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
   The butt of scandal having been,
   The calm existence which I prize
   The captain of a company.
   The captives of the Salguir"s shore.
   The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
   The chaise long ordered please employ,
   The channel of the river stilled
   The chief of the Chaldean wise,
   The child of sloth and liberty.
   The china teapot too ye might
   The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
   The clue unto some mystery
   The coach before a house stood still.
   The coach is borne o"er ruts and holes,
   The cold reply with gloomy mien
   The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
   The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
   The coming of life"s Autumn drear.
   The company deep silence guard.
   The comrade of your youth should strike,
   The connoisseur his glances throws
   The contact of the foot I raised
   The conversation tedious
   The conversation was revived
   The converse of our hermits twain,
   The converse of the world polite,
   The cool dark oaken grove to range,
   The counsel good and full of reason,
   The Country Damsel
   The country hath its liberties
   The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
   The crafty spouse caressed him, who
   The crash of music, candles" glare
   The credulous indeed are blest,
   The crowd and merriment and light,
   The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
   The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
   The crystals of her vestibule
   The curs away to kennel chase,
   The curse of commonplace delight.
   The curtain now they slowly raise.
   The cynosure of every eye.
   The damsel under escort place.
   "The date, his fleeting years how long-
   The date was fixed though oft postponed,
   The days of love and of romance!
   The days which to your youth belong?
   The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
   The deuce with my inside has played."
   The die is cast! Thine is my life!
   The disenchanted glass direct
   The door flew open-Olga came,
   The doors swing open: Lenski makes
   The drama of my youth was played.
   The dream left terror in its train.
   The drive becomes monotonous-
   The drum already doth arouse.
   The Duel
   The dusty chronicles of earth
   The early days of life we sought.
   The early tinkling of the bells
   The easier "tis to gain her grace,
   The epistle from the bard presents.
   The epitaph on marble shows:
   The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
   The evanescent fashions fly
   The excited hero in a trice
   The eyes of a grave general.
   The fair, nor parted with regret,
   The fair of the next generation,
   "The family are all quite well-
   The family of children hie.
   The family of Kharlikoff,
   The fashionable rhymester"s heart!
   The fatal bullet penetrate,
   The fatal hour had come at last-
   The fatal secrets of the grave,
   The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
   The fated nutriment desired;
   The father scarcely understands
   The feeble moment would espy
   The feet of graceful ladies fly,
   The feet of my dear lady friends.
   The fervid poet would recite,
   The fever of the blood to slake-
   The fire extinguished in his breast,
   The fire of the nocturnal lights;
   The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
   The fires of passion and its smart-
   The firmament in mellow light,
   The first appearance of the snows
   The first bright wreathing storm of snow
   The first-fruits of my tale I read,
   The fisher"s fire afar illumes
   The flimsy wares of Western marts,
   The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
   The foaming Lenski would refuse,
   The foes, as yet not taking aim,
   The foes with downcast eyes abide.
   The forests in mysterious gloom
   The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
   The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
   The freshness of her heart impair,
   The friend of liberty and laws
   The friends are called and quickly placed.
   The frolics of maidens.
   The fruits of learning and combined
   The fruits of science, evil, good,
   The Fête
   The general who accompanies.
   The German baker looks around
   The giddy world at last shall see.
   The gifted songster never swerved,
   The gilding of life"s vanities,
   The girl in marriage they unite.
   The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
   The glass unwittingly inspect
   The goblet still is bubbling bright-
   The God of Love is after you!
   The goddess would a masquerade
   The golden ember now enshrines,
   The gossip of their ladies fair.
   The guests make room; aside each takes
   The gulf between them was so vast,
   The hamlet, the poor villagers,
   The happiest days of life employ?
   The heart of the inveterate flirt!
   The heavens shone in deeper blue,
   The height of fashion, fitting tight,
   The hero is of my narration!
   The hero we immortalize.
   The hero"s name too in advance,
   The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
   The horizon luminous doth grow,
   The hostess doth interrogate:
   The hour when-Fate so willed-we met
   The hours once more Onéguine counts,
   The house and garden I would see."
   The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
   The household property contain:
   The household troop of little boys,
   The husband comes and interferes
   The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
   The idols of their adoration
   The image of her seal impressed.
   The imagination to enliven
   The "in memoriam" pages sought,
   The indignation of her heart!
   The inmate is for ever dumb,
   The inscription o"er the gates of Hell
   The insensate fire of love still glowed
   The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
   The journey in a sledge doth please,
   The kennel or a kindred line,
   The ladies" dresses airy, light,
   The ladies" laughter to provoke.
   The ladies, their fantastic dress,
   The lady in the crimson cap
   The lady"s glance upon him fell-
   The lamps illuminating shine;
   The lancer, to his calling bound,
   The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
   The language of her girlish pleading
   The languid eye of love-sick maids,
   The languid mind could smile at nought,
   The last poor obol I was worth-
   The laws of generations past,
   "The left? Why, what on earth is there?"-
   The less we love a lady fair
   The letter is the thing, you see,-
   The letter which Tattiana wrote.
   The lily"s stem to eat away,
   The limits of enlightenment
   The little solitary nook
   The lively trash of stories long
   The lonely mansion-house to screen
   "The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"-
   The Lord deliver her and save!
   The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
   The Lovelaces are out of date,
   The Làrinas unwisely went,
   The Làrinas were since sunrise
   The Làrinas would celebrate,
   The maid whose note he still possessed
   The maiden at her casement sits
   The Maidens" Song
   The maiden"s weary eye which yearned,
   The maids beside Tattiana keep-
   The malady of hopeless love
   The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
   The man and liked his company,
   The manly toga scarce assumed,
   The manners of the highest class
   The master always used to sit.
   The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
   The matter by his conscience tried,
   The matter did not agitate,
   The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
   The medium is required of gold.
   The memory of the bard, a dream,
   The memory of the bard was driven
   The men salute with lower bows
   The military band will play.
   The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
   The miserable bard to meet,
   The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
   The moderns of the ancients rave-
   The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
   The monsters of the British Muse
   The moon in the blue atmosphere.
   The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
   The moon, the stars, and shining night-
   The morn arises foggy, cold,
   The most industrious man alive
   The motley moving mass and bright,
   The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
   The Muse abandoned, ta"en a wife,
   The Muse appeared, when love passed by
   The Muse capricious let us coax,
   The Muse revealed her first delight,
   The mystic lines to tear away
   The mystic monogram, O. E.
   The native Russian tongue impeach?
   The natural fickleness of passion,
   The needle nor, o"er framework bent,
   The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
   The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
   The Neva"s Cleopatra, and
   The new moon"s crescent slim she spied,
   The nightingale there all night long,
   The nightingale trills forth her tune;
   The nights of golden Italy
   The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
   The old Derjavine noticed me,
   The old man who has had his freaks,
   The olden time shall be my theme.
   The opportunity is flown.
   The pains of night have wholly fled,
   The pall of night was growing thin,
   The Paris of those country parts
   The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
   The passionate speeches I"ll repeat,
   The path of hope and tender fear-
   The path which leads to glory"s goal.
   The peace which on his forehead beamed,
   The peasant blessed his happy fate.
   The peasants there are rich as kings,
   The perfidies I recollect
   The pervert world with icy chill
   The pile of books, with carpet spread
   The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
   The Poet
   The poet fell; already men
   The poet from Tamboff secured,
   The poet, modest though so grand,
   The poet"s fervid conversation
   The poet"s hour hath sounded-See!
   The poet"s madness? for "tis hard
   The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
   The poor girl fell into a faint,
   "The post hath kept him, it is like."
   The powder in the pan is laid,
   The prejudices all men have,
   The prince"s eye Onéguine seeks:
   The princess from the sofa cried
   The Princess N. will be at home
   The proud ones are not worth the fire
   The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
   The reaping girls approach and ply
   The remnant destiny concedes,
   The rigour of cold pride and all
   The riot of the world and glare
   The river through the linden wood.
   The river"s bank. Tattiana lone
   The room my former master used.
   The Russian language I deem vile
   The Russian N with nasal sound
   The Russian winter did adore
   The ruts of his own fatherland.
   The sad moon only could remark.
   The same unmoved oblivion
   The same warm vision constantly;
   The secrets of maidens.
   The secrets of the marriage state
   The seemly crowd, partaking nought
   The serpent to unlawful trees
   The servants used to congregate
   The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
   The sharp incisions of his nail,
   The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
   The shining orbs of night appear;
   The shining pistols are uncased,
   The shining river clothed in ice;
   The shopman and the pedlar rise
   The shutters open; to the skies
   The silent fields no peasant nears,
   The simple epitaph-a tear
   The sleep-compelling Grandison,
   The sneers of critics superfine;
   The snow descends and buries all,
   The snow upon the streets doth melt-
   The snows from off the hills around
   The solstice of our earthly years,
   The sorrows of a single state.
   The speech of man and tramp of horse.
   The starry beacons fade away,
   The steed benumbed still pawing stands
   The steward sent a note to tell
   The stomach doth admonish us.
   The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
   The story of his young love"s dream,
   The story of thy life and fate.
   The strange apartment her oppressed:
   The strife grew furious and Eugene
   The style in which my hero dressed;
   The style of wise antiquity.
   The sudden rattling of a car.
   The sum of my existence gone
   The sun had mounted high his steep,
   The swain of Julia Wolmar,
   The table with its lamp unlit,
   The tale of these romantic men;
   The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
   The third at night. Tattiana wakes
   The thirst for fame and man"s applause,
   The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
   The thunderbolt on you descend!
   The tightened leathern rein she draws,
   The time between the wolf and dogs-
   The time for mystic strolls which late
   The time when Melancholy"s claw
   The tiny sun shone less on high
   The tiresome man, her value knowing,
   The torment born of crime unseen,
   The torrent of opinion,
   The traveller, bird of passage he,
   The trees in silvery array,
   The triumph of a conquest new.
   The troop of apparitions fled,
   The twenty-sixth year of his age,
   The twilight pale which softens all,
   The two friends" compliments she hears
   The two old ladies then embraced
   The unaffected traits she now
   The unbidden guests he roughly chides-
   The uncontaminated kiss
   The untutored spirit"s pangs calmed down
   The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
   The venerable dame opined
   The verst posts catch the vacant eye
   The very morning of our days.
   The vestibule finds empty quite-
   The vile seducer shall not dare
   The village wherein yawned Eugene
   The voice of jealousy is drowned.
   The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
   The votary of vain delight
   The weary way still incomplete,
   The wedding-day had been arranged,
   The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
   The wind rose instantly, blew out
   The windows whitened, shutters close-
   The wit of others to acquire.
   The witching light of sympathy;
   The wolf upon the highways bold
   The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
   The wood she enters-bear behind,-
   The woods, still naked to the view,
   The words and looks of charmers sweet
   The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
   The workpeople she superintended,
   The works of Mr. Richardson.
   The world enough. Congratulate
   The world is ever altering!
   The young proprietor we find;
   The young Simeonova too there
   "The younger, you"re in love with her!"
   The youthful lover once again
   The youthful poet"s fond confession.
   Thee but a little space bewept,
   Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
   Thee only would I choose, in truth,
   Their branches by the snow bowed down.
   Their claims and explanations shout.
   Their coming which no man expects,
   Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
   Their giddy sports she ne"er enjoyed.
   Their glory with their heels of red
   Their harmless conversation blends
   Their heroes used to represent
   Their idols they were wont to invest
   Their insolence and waistcoats white
   Their Jealousy and separation
   Their looks alone produce the spleen.
   Their memory lingers still and seems
   Their natural attractions lend
   Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
   Their offspring"s innocent flirtations
   Their own productions, some insist
   Their privileged allurements fire
   Their slander e"en was weariness;
   Their voices nought to her impart
   "Then amongst strangers I was left-
   Then be it so! My destiny
   Then became busy with the house,
   "Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
   Then dressed himself...(*)
   Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
   Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
   Then glittering in the sun descends.
   Then handed her the song with grace.
   Then he"d malign them secretly
   Then, her distraction to allay,
   Then, I say truly, none but thee
   "Then, in the country, is"t not true?
   Then in the silent cabinet
   Then it may be, O flattering tale,
   Then my companions young with pleasure
   Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
   "Then send your grandson quietly
   Then suddenly discharge a joke
   Then, the far capital forgot,
   Then the old dames in chorus sing,
   Then, then-well, in some solitude
   Then they came easily enow,
   Then they"re so innocent of vice,
   Then to reward such confidence
   Then to some gallant in your turn
   Then touching Olga they depart
   Then weeping she sank back distressed
   Then would we muse as in a trance,
   Then ye were barely generous,
   There an imperious skeleton;
   There, aping Gulnare"s bard, he spanned
   There came a sudden flash of light,
   There Didelot became glorious,
   There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
   There friends of pure delight had been
   There, in that knot of company,
   There is a spot the village near
   There is no fishmarket retort
   There is no path; the storm hath strewn
   There is no stupid calumny
   There is no wreath upon the bough:
   There jars of cider block the way,
   There long time sad at heart he stayed:
   There our Katènine did revive
   There! take it quickly, if ye must).
   There the confusion, pressure, heat,
   There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
   There, there, beneath the side-scene"s shade
   There was no angling for success.
   There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
   There, when the rains of spring we mark
   There"ll be a fight. I do not lie.
   Thereon the passing traveller read:
   These are your relatives, believe:
   These evenings as in days of old
   These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
   These take their seats; the coach of state
   These to the coach of state are bound,
   They are all natural and low,
   They blossom, ripen and they fall
   They crack a feeble joke and smile-
   They deem her somewhat finical,
   They disappeared by stealth and guile,
   They first of all my brow did wreathe
   They growl a bit-they scandalise-
   They hand in hand to table go.
   They have invited you this week."
   They in a peaceful life preserved
   They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
   They long ago had held debate.
   They long at home have her expected-
   They made him feel inclined to doze;
   They may forget that we exist.
   They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
   They sang, whilst negligently seated,
   They sat, but conversation"s flow
   They sent their compliments-but oh!
   They shout and no one lists at all.
   They shovel silver with a spade,
   They stir the heart as heretofore.
   They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
   They were the wonderful traditions
   They will receive us with delight."
   They wish that ladies should, I hear,
   They would not solemnly debate
   Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
   Thine honour is my countersign!
   Thinking: "tis foolish to disturb
   Thinking to float upon the stream,
   This anchorite amid his waste
   (This by command; for it was found,
   This evanescent boyish bliss.
   This gentle daring who could guess?
   This glitter, riot, emptiness,
   This great discovery relief
   This he believed: a kindred spirit
   This is my master"s sitting-room.
   (This joking I used to protest),
   This life in masquerade concealed,
   This lot in life with stern decree?
   This monument of thought profound
   This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
   This northern summer of our own,
   This separated us as well-
   This, this were true felicity!
   This was his social character.
   This wicked, that absurd he deems,
   This world. I do not praise desire,
   Thither hussars on leave will stray
   Thither in future to proceed
   Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
   Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
   Those whom we ought to love, caress,
   Thou also, my ideal true,
   Thou also, reader generous,
   Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
   Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
   Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
   Thou hast resigned thy destiny
   Thou too farewell, my liberty!
   Though around honoured Priam"s throne
   Though Baratynski verses penned,
   Though beauty he no more adored,
   Though by an error and unsought-
   (Though certainly mankind he knew
   Though correspondence as a rule
   Though dazzling its effulgence white,
   Though deep he sinks into the drift;
   Though for his Helen Menelaus
   Though, God be praised! he ne"er designed
   Though he advanced unceasingly.
   Though he surveyed her at his ease,
   Though hitherto a lady ne"er
   Though I confess I hardly dare
   Though I"ll return to him right early,
   Though late, have a beginning made.
   Though now my love might be intense,
   Though of romance therein I fail
   Though scarcely following what was said,
   Though some men, evilly disposed,
   Though superannuated rather;
   Though the foul vision promise made
   Though to the Academy I come
   Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
   Though we will not acknowledge it.
   Though without palaces and streets,
   Thou"lt quaff love"s sweet envenomed stream,
   Thou"lt suffer, dearest, but before,
   Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
   Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
   Three mortal hours per diem he
   Three pairs of handsome female feet;
   Three tears they dropt with humble mein
   Thrice happy who their agonies
   Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
   Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
   Through dense aristocratic rows
   Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
   Thus a guest with composure will
   Thus age approached, the common doom,
   Thus carelessly I once portrayed
   Thus did our friend Onéguine preach:
   Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
   Thus having braved Apollo"s rage
   Thus her perversity hath shown.
   Thus in a style obscure and stale,
   Thus in the earth the seed expands
   Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
   Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
   Thus oft-this I myself confess-
   Thus our light race grows up and lives,
   Thus, praised be God! a reputation
   Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
   Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
   Thus the time passes and meanwhile
   Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
   Thus to assassinate the eve?"-
   Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
   Thus we began our little tale-
   Thus widely meditation erred,
   Thy cheek is as a poppy red!"
   Thy dove, thy darling little pet
   Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
   Thy meditative incantation-
   Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
   Till absently Vladimir took
   Till amid trees a hovel showed,
   Till carriage lamps, a double row,
   Till January fell no snow-
   Till morn-life uniform but gay,
   Till out of breath upon a seat
   Till proper rings could be procured.
   Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
   Till the mazurka"s close he stays,
   Time flies! a genial air abroad,
   Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
   Time to denote by dinner, tea,
   Time was, a valiant general might
   Time was, his raillery was gay,
   Time was, in style magniloquent
   Time was, the breath of early dawn
   Time was the flattering voice of fame,
   Time was, the poet"s tender quill
   Time was, two maidens from their home
   Time was when cold seduction strove
   Time will the ravages efface-
   Time without me will lessons give,
   Time-honoured Kremlin"s keys present.
   Tired by the ball"s incessant noise,
   Tiresome unto her hath become
   "Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
   "Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
   "Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
   "Tis day, the family downstairs,
   "Tis done. To supper they proceed.
   "Tis dreadful-ye agree, I hope-
   "Tis evidently Heaven"s will
   "Tis fearful to anticipate
   "Tis finished. Horrible to read!
   "Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
   ""Tis habit, Lenski."-"Is your ill
   "Tis Heaven"s will and I am thine.
   "Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
   "Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
   "Tis in your power now, if desired,
   "Tis noisome to her there: in thought
   "Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
   "Tis now the hillock now the rill
   "Tis now the season! Idlers all,
   "Tis said you are a misanthrope,
   "Tis silent all! Alone the cries
   "Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
   "Tis silent-on her shines the moon-
   "Tis something of this sort I deem.
   "Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
   "Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;

   ""Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.

   "Tis time to quit this weary shore
   "Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!"
   Titles and ages intermixed.
   To a surrender gave consent,
   To accompany him and to escort
   To agitate me in my dreams.
   To all good neighbours" sport conduced.
   To all she answers cruelly-
   To an assembly-she appeared
   To anticipate the break of day,
   To arid selfishness resigned,
   To arm the tongue and e"en the eye,
   To array himself in evening dress.
   To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
   To ask her name the trouble took.
   To banish far unworthy themes
   To be a charming mystery:
   To be in conversation clear
   To bear love"s parching agonies-
   To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
   To bring behind: the triple steeds
   To burn, yet reason keep awake
   To captivate her how devoted!
   To cheat the inexperienced fair,
   To clank the spur, delight the fair-
   To classicism I"ve homage paid,
   To cock the pistol; barrel bend
   To consanguineous dinners they
   To cool the cutlets" seething grease,
   To cope with Ay no more I dare,
   To crush me with a just disdain.
   To dire contentment shall give birth
   To dominate her worthy lord,
   To dream upon the sunny strand
   To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
   To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
   To ease the anguish of my breast.
   To end with him her path below.
   To Eve the universal mother,
   To fawn upon and love express;
   To find in gossip such delight,
   To flight before her radiant look,
   To follow you in every place,
   To foreign lands he would allude,
   To freeze his finger hath begun,
   To friendship making no pretence,
   To God eternal hymns of praise.
   To guess how you the eve pull through."-
   To happiness contributing.
   To help her to the other shore
   To her an elegy composed.
   To his Penates now returned,
   To idle musing was a prey;
   To jest as he had done last eve,
   To kiss the feet which I admired!
   To labour in his sledge forgot,
   To lawless love I should prefer-
   To lay two covers secretly.
   To light had brought them from their dust,
   To listen to the rippling rill.
   To listen to the words you speak,
   To loiter there in idleness
   To look on life as on a show,
   To Love all ages lowly bend,
   To Lucifer the cock must breathe
   To make wise men the idiot play
   To male acquaintances he bows,
   To many a noisy feast and fight,
   To mark with a contemptuous smile.
   To me he would his Olga give,
   To mention the foregoing eve,
   To move in fashionable life,
   To mutter her concealed desire
   To my old nurse alone peruse,
   To Olga frequently he would
   To Olga Petoushkova darts:
   To our Tattiana conquering,
   To part in amity with thee!
   To pass the night at home hath gone.
   To pass with reasonable men
   To peer into the future tries.
   To purest love he tuned his note
   To raise a clamour and a din:
   To raise his pistol to his eye,
   To romp and play she ne"er would go:
   To Russ indigenous are not;
   To russify the foreign phrase
   To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
   To secrets of virgins,
   To see aught-never mind meanwhile)
   To see his Olga ere the fray-
   To see you by our fireside stand,
   To seek him out with bended head.
   To shallow sentiment a slave!
   To sigh and meditate alone:
   To sketch myself that I have tried
   To sketch ye in Albano"s style.
   To slay himself with blade or ball,
   To standards in which we believe?
   To stay the maid against her will.
   To strike imagination serve.
   To such-delightful to repel.
   To swagger as the art of love,
   To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
   To take a hand at whist oft come:
   To take this letter to O- Well!
   To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
   To the abandoned dwelling-place.
   To the assembly her they bear.
   To the fair object of his dream,
   To the impressions of our youth,
   To the pianoforte he moves
   To the sarcastic observation,
   To the theatre he repairs
   To the young girl he said adieu,
   To the youth Eugene hurried now-
   To this arrangement can be seen,
   To thy decree my will I bend.
   To tragedy, the fainting fit,
   To treat the matter as a jest,
   To two young oaks the coachman leads.
   To understand by slow degrees
   To vary for a few brief days.
   To visit, lovely maid, return,
   To visit Moscow in the season.
   To wander through the meadows still,
   To watch with lovers" ecstasies,
   To what malicious merriment,
   To whisper comfort, love and hope?
   To whom amongst the jealous throng
   To whom are our misfortunes grief
   "To whom is it to go, my sweet?
   To whom we used to consecrate
   To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
   To whom your hearts were consecrate,-
   To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
   To write his forefathers to warn
   To write in cantos twenty-five.
   To write of any other elf
   To youthful Olga"s beauty bright,
   Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
   To-day it is my turn to teach.
   To-day, my friends, at any rate,

   Together they returned, nor word
   Together we have wandered o"er

   To-morrow Tania we will show,
   "To-morrow"s dawn will glimmer gray,
   Too much I"m given to intersperse,
   Took aim-but as immediately
   Torquato Tasso"s strains I deem.
   Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
   Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
   Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
   Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
   Transfixed Onéguine mine doth stay.
   Transparent o"er the Neva beamed
   Transported to our Russian clime.
   Trembles at artificial shame.
   Trembles upon my lips from spite,-
   Trembling he seeks the young princess-
   Triquet arose, and for the bard
   Triumphant by anticipation,
   Triumphant with the answer come.
   Triumphs-their own or those of friends-
   Troy"s sages should in concert own
   True friend, landlord benevolent,
   Turned and replied as it behoved,
   Turned to her and discordantly

   Twice in the year to fast were bound,
   Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
   Two dressed in uniform appear-
   Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
   Two hearts perchance were desolate
   Two minutes they in silence spent,
   Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
   Two poles together glued by ice,
   Two verses he could recollect
   "Twould serve ye in an epigram-
   Undeviating and insane
   Undoubtedly, disdain alone
   Undressed herself and went to bed

   Unfavourable unto her.
   Unhappily too salt by far;
   Unknown as yet the aching heart,
   Unknown to all he doth appear,
   Unknown to all, without a tie,
   Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
   Unseen in thick and tangled grass
   Unseen thou wast already dear.
   Until her heart less high should bound-
   Until her powers of running fail.
   Until the sleepless Bréguet chime
   Unto a carping world must show-
   Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
   Unto Anicia for the keys
   Unto her husband, went away-
   Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
   Unto his own Tattiana he,
   Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell-
   Unto the fields she makes her way,
   Unto the gates the servants fly
   Unto the hero of this lay
   Unto the sounding sea to list,
   Unto the windmill he must ride
   Unto their solitude one day,
   Up to the attic, and all need
   Upon a bunch of lovage green;
   Upon a soul inert and cloyed?-
   Upon her brow sits wrath alone-
   Upon her cheek by adulation
   Upon her elbow she reclines,
   Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
   Upon his couch insensibly;
   Upon its damp opacity,
   Upon my lake I love to float,
   Upon my visions such intrude.
   Upon the ball-room"s glassy floor
   Upon the Don"s broad pastures bred
   Upon the dreary northern snows,
   Upon the earth a mist did lie
   Upon the highway of the sea
   Upon the meadows showering,
   Upon the opening page ye find:
   Upon the stage his weary glance.
   Upon the table in a trice
   Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
   Upon the windows tracery,
   Upon those margins she perceived
   Upon those pages she descries
   Upon your daughters keep an eye,
   Upward in a thin stream inclines.
   Urging your droshkies swift as air

   Us from the world wherein we live.

   Vanished his youthful years at last,
   Variety of speech and vests,
   Verses and tears et cetera.
   Vexation? Vanity? or strove
   Vice had due punishment awarded,
   Vice in romance is glorified
   Viewed them with not a little scorn,
   Villages in the distance show
   Virgins miraculous I see,
   Virtue was with a bride rewarded.

   Wallow, my friends, in company!
   "Warm yourself here a little space!"
   Warmth I imagined in your glance,
   Was a delightful little spot,
   Was born beside the Neva, where
   Was certainly no Grandison.
   Was certainly not erudite
   Was drawn, ideal of my lay-
   Was famous for thick-headedness.
   Was he in health and void of care?-
   Was it not so?-for thee I gave,
   Was it not thou, O vision bright,
   Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
   Was not surprised thereby at all.
   Was nothing but the British spleen
   Was ready for self-sacrifice,
   Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
   Was that which we are wont to call
   Was the first question Olga made,
   Was the meek love a maiden feels.
   Was the old and forgotten coach;
   Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
   Was uttered, and the cabin shook-
   Was with himself dissatisfied.
   Was withered ere the morning light-
   Was wont with me at cards to play.
   Was worthy of that old baboon,
   Was younger than myself, my light,
   We all of us of education
   We are the first who such a name
   We called to mind our youthful days-
   We glide along a floor of wax.
   We hear with interest intense
   We must admit but little taste
   "We never loved in days of old,
   We Russians, friends from distant parts
   We visit about Christmas Day,
   Wearied of leisure in the end,
   Weeping they loosed my tresses long
   Well, if your pistol ball by chance
   Well! just as she was yesterday.
   Well known unto Onéguine mine.
   Well! Làrina appears to us
   Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
   "Well!"-"I the elder should prefer,
   Were I like you a bard by trade-
   Were stripped with melancholy sound,
   Were to analysis subjected.
   Were you in love when you were young?"-
   Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
   What a storm of emotions keen
   What acrimonious scorn I trace
   What agitation languidly
   "What ails thee, dear?"-"I feel depressed.
   "What ails thee?"-"Nothing."-He is fled.
   What are they? Gladly would I yield
   What bitter tears with thee I shed!
   What boots it with the age to strive?
   "What can be done? She is no child!"
   "What can be drearier than the house,
   What do I ask? What cause assigned
   What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
   What doth she see? Around the board
   What everybody long has known;
   "What! Grandison?"-"Yes, certainly!"
   What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
   What I by relatives conceive?
   What, invitations? The same day
   What is his latest character?
   What is thy cleverness to me?
   "What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
   What jokes and guesses now abound,
   What languor would his silence show,
   What more"s required? The world replies,
   What never was remarked or heard
   What once I knew is clean forgot-
   What pleasures Hymen would prepare
   What! really going? "Tis too bad!
   What sad emotions o"er me steal
   What say you? to the family-
   What they in conversation said?-
   What visions then her fancy thronged-
   What will the coming dawn reveal?
   When all around the entrance pressed,
   When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
   When but a boy he Olga loved
   When captured in a schoolboy"s cap;
   When deaf and silent he doth lie
   When Eugene like a ghost did rise
   When evening o"er the landscape looms,
   When first upon my cheek I feel
   When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
   When harsh demeanour hath consigned
   When he in ardent verse portrays
   When hope"s delightful flower but bloomed
   When I yon semicircle bright
   When in as instant she is lost,-
   When in her walks abroad she met
   When in simplicity ye wrote
   When in that company she saw
   When in the grand saloon was heard
   When in the study"s calm retreat,
   When motionless your gaze beneath
   When o"er a glass with friends we prate
   When on the pallid eastern sky
   When Passion"s fire no longer glows
   When people with long countenance
   When poets lachrymose recite
   When separation"s hour drew nigh,
   When shall I wing my passage free
   When, sitting by his fire alone
   When tea was brought. "Tis my delight
   When that time comes, a poem I"ll strive
   When the hour came to bid good-bye-
   When the mazurka used to peal,
   When the obedient doll in sport
   When the same life before him lies
   When the sonorous Bréguet tells
   When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
   When to enlarge we shall succeed,
   When, where, and in what desert land,
   When will my hour of freedom come!
   When will the devil take his own!"
   When, wise at length, we seek repose
   When youth"s rebellious hour drew near
   Whene"er a brilliant courtly dame
   Whene"er across the plain at speed
   Whene"er he had an aching head;
   Where all upon the surface lies,-
   Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
   Where better?
   Where dwelt the Muses" worshipper,
   Where each young critic ready stands,
   Where every day before his eyes
   Where fashionable circles meet
   Where God alone knows whom she met.
   Where harsh frivolity proclaims
   Where I can no more recollect?-
   Where in the country Eugene yet,
   Where is he who doth not deceive?
   Where is Onéguine? Half asleep,
   Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
   Where long time he in solitude
   Where many another hand had signed
   Where melancholy rocks arise
   Where my days in the wilderness
   Where Nereids murmur evermore,
   Where plentifully feelings flow
   Where shining runs the tiny brook,
   Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
   Where the first time I saw your face,-
   Where the first time she met with him.
   Where thine equal shall we find?
   Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
   Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
   Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
   Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
   Wherefore am I your quarry held?-
   Wherefore regarding him express
   Wherefore? She found a secret joy
   Wherein a space Onéguine spent.
   Wherein I buried left my heart.
   Wherein I castigation get;
   Wherein I felt love"s fatal dart,
   Wherein love innocently pines.
   Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
   Wherein the child of fashion strict
   Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
   Wherein the miserable wife
   Wherein we lately left the twain.
   Whereto in language courteous
   Where-"-"What! another eclogue spin?
   Which afterwards the muse revived.
   Which all her darling friends have scrawled
   Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
   Which crushing dignity must brook!
   Which falls in starry flakes below.
   Which from the devil"s bookcase start,
   Which glowed with virginal desire.
   Which in a hilly neighbourhood
   Which in the elevated sphere
   Which in the winter were a joy:
   Which in your spirit dominates,
   Which is he? or an imitation,
   Which lessons unto us repeat,
   Which might for many ages last.
   Which "neath her pillow lay till morn.
   Which never have existed, e"en
   Which o"er the waters boldly leap,
   Which of approaching labour tells
   Which Ovid once immortalized,
   Which rankled in Tattiana"s breast,
   Which rushed in eager dense array
   Which shines with iridescent hues.

   Whilst cheerily the embers shone,

   Whilst homeward by the nearest route
   Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
   Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
   Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
   Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
   Whilst struggling for the heritage.
   Whilst the fond parents, friends thro" life,
   Whilst the tired serving-men without
   Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
   White Moscow raises her old spires,
   Whither along them doth he pelt?
   Whither and wherefore do I speed
   Whither at headlong speed doth go
   "Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"-
   Whither departed is the host?
   Whither shall he go first? He"ll see,
   Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
   Whither that evening he will go.
   Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
   Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
   Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
   Who by a haughty word or glance
   Who can help loving mother Moscow?
   Who cannot conjure former joys?
   Who dreams expound and prophecies.
   Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
   Who early died a gallant death,"
   Who every gesture, every phrase
   Who floats contentedly through life,
   Who following Petrarch move along
   Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
   Who from two years to thirty tell;
   Who glory, wealth and dignities
   Who had for four long years survived
   Who, heard the music of my lay,
   Who in the agony of grief
   Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
   Who in thy love finds more delight
   "Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"-
   Who knows? with love"s consuming flame
   Who labours hard to humour us?
   Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
   Who now could fail to recognize
   Who reads his visionary theme
   Who secretly denounced the gift,
   Who selfishly unmoved remain
   Who the romance do not complete,
   Who this soft nonsense could impart,
   Who thrives this moment as I write,
   Who to surrender did not blench
   Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
   Who tyrannizes us with ease,
   Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
   "Who will be there?"-"The family.
   Who with a scuffle and a shout
   Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"-
   Who without more prevarication
   Who words and actions will adjust
   "Who would have thought it? As of yore!
   Who would the maiden innocent
   Wholly beside herself with fear,

   Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
   Whom jealous transport cannot move,
   Whom latterly one often meets
   Whom pale Diana"s ray illumes-
   Whom thirty centuries adore.
   Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
   Whom you in slumber may have seen."
   Whose author nature understood
   Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
   Whose countless golden crosses glow
   Whose glance reflecting inspiration
   Whose hands indulgently caress
   Whose heart experience icy made
   Whose hearts responsive have remained
   Whose memories make the heart beat quick
   Whose memory doth not refuse
   Whose qualities appeared to afford
   Whose tones Apollo"s sons inspire,

   "Why did you leave last night so soon?"
   Why did you visit our poor place?
   Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?-

   Winter! The peasant blithely goes
   Winter"s approach she doth not hail
   With affectation,-nothing more.
   With all dissatisfaction shows.
   With all their progeny were there,
   With an imagination wild,
   With ardent sighs and flattery
   With bated breath, around she bends
   With better half as cumbersome;
   With bitter tears my mother prayed,
   With blessings on the ditches and
   With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
   With blunted pencil-point adorns.
   With boiling torrent dark and gray;
   With book in hand reclined in bed,
   With cherries, red currants,
   With childlike lisp will lie to please.
   With clouded brow stands silently?
   With dance and with song.
   With deeper woe than others" grief.
   With effort she restrains. Well nigh
   With epigrams impertinent,
   With Eugene pranks of former years
   With eye precise and without fail.
   With fir-trees standing motionless
   With flame more ardent passion burns,
   With folded arms and eyes bent low,
   With footsteps tremulous with awe
   With gay design and silken stitch.
   With great delight.-O God on high!
   With her they did associate,
   With him were friends eternally:
   With his exasperated sense,
   With his ferocious mate appears.
   With his own pawn alas! his rook!
   With hisses Cleopatra scares,
   With hope and then perplexity,
   With hopeless passion: from her bed
   With humble prose I"ll fill my page
   With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
   With inexact pronunciation
   With intellect, a taste refined,
   With intellect and strong volition
   With iridescent wing doth flap
   With it may be a couple more;
   With its exhilarating flow,
   With jealous fear, anxiety.
   With jealous fire resuscitate,
   With jest and gossip gaily blent.
   With late repentance gnaws and stings.
   With laughter smothered weariness:
   With lengthened howl and accent loud,
   With little knowledge and that wrong
   With loud explosion, the bright wine
   With love which happiness extends;
   With lovers" rubbish filled, was neat
   With many a snare their pathway line!
   With many a vacancy, "tis said."-
   With Martin Zadeka. In woe
   With me Caucasian rocks beside!
   With measured step and even gait
   With mute appeal to ask they seem-
   With Olga; nor of this appeared
   With one foot resting on its tip
   With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
   With our Onéguine doth aspire
   With Ozeroff was wont to share
   With pallid light, but Eugene lay
   With pungent or obtuse retort,
   With purple hand Aurora leads,
   With quite a lachrymose expression
   With rapturous longing he awaits,
   With raspberries, cherries.
   With roses, caps and looks malign;
   With sad refrain misfortune near.
   With satisfaction marvellous,
   With scandal"s trivial ornament.
   With serious air then went away
   With shame I shudder and with dread-
   With smiling face he Lenski hears;
   With so much warmth and intellect?
   With spiritual tenderness;
   With such a perversity proclaim.
   With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
   With taffety instead of crape.
   With tears, confused emotions, bliss,-
   With tears which secret sufferers love-
   With tenderness hath recognized
   With the epistle of my fair;
   With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
   With thee I conversed when I bore
   With this immoderate request
   With this unpleasant tête-à-tête,
   With thoughts of a far distant land,
   With tranquil air Onéguine leads
   With tumult or contentment still
   With unanimity complete,
   With us is easily attained.
   With us "tis quite a novelty
   With "vale" finish off a note;
   With what avidity and zest
   With which blind Fortune oft betrays
   With words of foreign origin
   With worldly honours, it may be,
   Within her; she is sick at heart;
   Within his memory there lay,
   Within his mind Tattiana bore,
   Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
   Within its wave the sounding pail,
   Within my memory I bore
   Within resounded shriek and shout:
   Within that secret court discussed,
   Without a chance to slip away.
   Without amaze or wrath displayed:
   Without constraint in conversation
   Without disguise ourselves explain.
   Without disgust we look upon?
   Without enthusiasm he met
   Without grammatical mistakes.
   Without participation hears,
   Without profession, business, wife,
   Without the faintest trace to leave
   Without the ken of parents both,
   Without the least constraint he bowed.
   Without them Eugene is complete;
   Would agitate a mystic wreath
   Would at the proper time appear.
   Would haste in agitation dire
   Would loiter by the looking-glass,
   Would lose his slippers or gazette.
   Would once in powdered wig appear;
   Would she in silence long remain.
   Would she the canvas tight enrich
   Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
   Would whisper: shall I so long live?"-
   Would you to me this Phyllis show,
   Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
   Wrapt in oblivion complete,
   Writ in my honour now and then-
